Folks who are rich or poor, urban or suburban. Homeowners and renters. Landlords, too. Not to mention decades of policymakers from his political party and the other one, too.\nAnd he\u2019s 100% correct in tying inaction to self-interest. It\u2019s a natural defense mechanism against change in all situations, especially when an issue like housing puts literally trillions of dollars of wealth at stake.\n\u201cTime and time again, bigger, bolder reform hasn\u2019t happened \u2014 in part because of some legitimate concerns,\u201d \n\u201cMany of our lowest-income residents understandably worry about being pushed out of their own communities because of gentrification. Middle-class homeowners worry that their single-family home could lose its value \u2014 a scary prospect given a house is often a family\u2019s biggest asset.\n\u201cThese real concerns should not be brushed aside. At the same time, we also know the status quo is simply unacceptable \u2014 we aren\u2019t building enough housing.\u201d\nShaming inaction is a laudable tactic. But one often unspoken challenge is that the status quo is EXACTLY what a chunk of the real estate industry wants.\nNewsom says sacrifices are needed from the homeowner who\u2019s bet their life savings on a California home. He suggests the same from the tenement-dweller who accepts their dumpy rental because there\u2019s no better option and they live one layoff or medical bill away from homelessness.\nBut what about the real estate industry?\nCalifornia is one of the nation\u2019s most-profitable places to build a home, sell or finance one or own an apartment complex. That\u2019s due, in part, to the modest supply of housing available in the state\u2019s growing economy.\nDo you expect the industry to willingly give up that profitable perch?\nNewsom and many others suggest the supply slice of the homelessness challenge is simple economics, more homes equal lower costs. But similar economic pressures suggest the state\u2019s real estate world will protect its turf in a very NIMBY way.\nIt\u2019s not just your typical Californian who doesn\u2019t want the homeless shelter or \u201caffordable\u201d housing down the block. The portfolios of big landlords and major landowners may be harmed as well.\nOr you hear of industry calls for \u201chelp\u201d to make lower-priced home construction \u201cprofitable.\u201d\nLet\u2019s look at last year\u2019s \nNewsom called for greater \u201caccountability\u201d in the housing challenges. What about this industry error?\nThe industry is good at seeking \u201chelp\u201d from the government. Requests to loosen environmental constraints and ease regulatory approvals have merit. But what of industry demands for lowering \u201cfees\u201d charged in the process?\nMany of these much-debated development fees are attempts by local governments to recoup infrastructure costs associated with new communities \u2014 schools, sewers, roads, first responders, etc. And some reasonable proposals have been floated to find state money to help lower these fees, which often are pushed all the way to the price the eventual buyer pays.\nIt\u2019s a win-win if future cuts in developer fees equal homebuyer savings and not greater profits for homebuilders.\nAnd it\u2019s not just new construction.\nWhat about the unnecessary complexity, not to mention the costs, of actually acquiring a home, new or used, or renting one. While we consider retooling state laws to make construction easier, what about regulations that could ease the acquisition and financing of housing, not to mention open up the transactions\u2019 field to new entrants in order to boost competition?\nIf California wants to really fix this problem, all stakeholders must accept change for the greater good.
