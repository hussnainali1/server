Staton issued a temporary restraining order late Friday, Feb. 21, and scheduled a hearing for 2 p.m. Monday, Feb. 24.\nThe city filed its request for a legal injunction on Friday after learning a day earlier that Fairview was being considered by federal and state officials as a quarantine site. State Assemblywoman Cottie Petrie-Norris, whose district includes Costa Mesa, said other sites are also under consideration.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t immediately clear where those are.\nFairview is a 60-year-old, state-owned campus on Harbor Boulevard that was once home to about 2,000 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. It\u2019s now nearly empty as the state has moved residents into community homes and other living situations.\nCity officials don\u2019t yet know how many people might be placed at Fairview, whether they would have tested positive for or be showing symptoms of coronavirus (officially known as COVID-19), what protocols would be followed or how long the center might be used, Costa Mesa Mayor Katrina Foley said. Americans returning from overseas who may have been exposed to the virus have typically been quarantined for 14 days.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so many unknowns. We don\u2019t know what the plan is,\u201d Foley said. \u201cThe city has not been part of any of the process that led to the consideration of the site and it would be unfair to not include us in this kind of significant decision that has great impact on our community.\u201d\nWhile the virus can cause severe illness and even death, health and infectious disease experts have said the risk to most Americans is low, noting that it is mainly passed between people who are in close contact via droplets from coughs or sneezes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s website late Friday listed 14 confirmed cases in the U.S., but a CNN article said the agency is reporting 34 domestic cases, including American cruise ship passengers who just returned to the U.S.\nCosta Mesa\u2019s court filing said federal authorities (including the CDC, Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense) and state agencies (including the Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services and Department of General Services) propose to relocate \u201c35 to 50 patients already diagnosed with the coronavirus from a secure location on Travis Air Force Base\u201d to Fairview, which was \u201cnot intended to house individuals infected with a highly contagious and deadly disease.\u201d\nCity officials are asking the federal court to block a transfer until the site is determined suitable to house the patients.\nFoley said city officials learned of the proposal to quarantine patients at Fairview late Thursday, Feb. 20, and have been trying to get information since then, largely to no avail.\nState Department of General Services spokeswoman Monica Hassan wrote in an email that the directive came from the CDC and any questions should be directed to that agency. Hassan\u2019s department is in charge of state-owned properties including Fairview.\nOfficials with the CDC and state Health and Human Services Agency could not immediately be reached for comment late Friday.\n\u201cThe federal government is evaluating a number of potential secondary sites for the treatment of California coronavirus patients,\u201d Petrie-Norris said in an email. She added that she would be shocked if Fairview is chosen, given its location in \u201ca densely populated urban community,\u201d and that her office will share information as it becomes available.\nFairview is surrounded on three sides by a golf course and abuts a residential neighborhood. It includes more than a dozen mostly empty buildings that would likely require substantial preparation to serve as a medical facility."},"2":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tThe tale of this Marine in the \u2018other\u2019 Iwo Jima photo can, at last, be told\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/the-tale-of-this-marine-in-the-other-iwo-jima-photo-can-at-last-be-told\/","discription":"\nBill Seltzer is the fourth Marine on the right in the photo above, the one with his foot on the stump in front of the American flag flying over Mt.

If I was planning to write anything on the anniversary of the flag raising, could I please mention Bill, they asked?\nThere were a lot of Marines and Navy men who went up that hill after it was secured, but they didn\u2019t fight their way up, Sallie said.

They thought the worst was behind them.\u201d\nBut soon after this picture was taken, Seltzer\u2019s platoon was ordered to move out, the fight was not done. The Japanese, who had been lying in wait in the tunnels and spider holes, attacked them from the rear, killing another four men in this picture.\n\u201cAs Bill was telling me the story, he was reliving the battle again in his mind,\u201d Pietro said. \u201cHe was back in the tunnels and the hours of hand to hand combat that he endured after becoming lost inside them. He talked of the relief he felt of finally getting out.\n\u201cNone of that ever escaped him, just like the men who died in that place and would never escape their fate \u2013 the men he would always call heroes. Bill believed he was the last, living survivor of the men who fought their way to the top of Mount Suribachi, an honor he held, but lamented, as well. I hope you can understand why.\n\u201cHe was that man next to you in the grocery aisle, or driving alongside you down Magnolia or Buena Vista boulevards in his beloved Burbank. You would never suspect that he, along with his comrades and brothers in arms, changed the world.\u201d\nSeltzer came home to a 32-year career with NASA, helping put John Glenn and Alan Shepard into space, and piloting his own plane at Whiteman Airport. While at NASA, he also got a P.H.D in medical clinical engineering from UCLA, helping develop the CT scanner and MRI technology.\nOn the seventh day, he rested.\nWith all his accomplishments, the one he was most proud of, and yes, lamented, as well, was standing in front of that American flag on Mount Siribachi with his Marine platoon, he told his wife and Pietro.\nAll of them smiling on the outside for Rosenthal\u2019s camera, but crying inside for their buddies who didn\u2019t make it to the top.\nThe real heroes, Bill Seltzer called them."},"3":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tNew bill would cap mobile home rent hikes statewide\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/new-bill-would-cap-mobile-home-rent-hikes-statewide\/","discription":"\nCalifornia legislators passed a law last year that limited rent increases for tenants in buildings at least 15 years old.\nBut the measure, AB 1482, did not include mobile homes, allowing park owners to raise space rent as much as they want.\nA new bill unveiled Friday, Feb. 21, would change that.\nAssemblymember Sharon Quirk-Silva, D-Fullerton, unveiled a plan to place rent caps on all California mobile homes.

USA Gymnastics filed for Chapter 11 protection in December 2018. \n\nThe 77-page filing states that if they approve the settlement agreement, the 517 Nassar survivors would agree to release \u201cany and all claims arising from or related to Abuse Claims or Future Claims.\u201d \n\nIn addition to the USOPC, Penny, the Karolyis and five Karolyi-related businesses, the settlement proposal also calls for the release of former U.S. Olympic team and SCATS coach Don Peters, 2012 Olympic coach John Geddert, former USA Gymnastics senior vice president Rhonda Faehn, former USA Gymnastics board chairman Paul Parilla, former USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi, former USA Gymnastics national teams manager Amy White, former USA Gymnastics sports medicine official Debra Van Horn and the All Olympia Gymnastics Center in Southern California. \n\n\u201cUSOPC is a beneficiary of the Settlement Election\u2019s release and its injunctions,\u201d according to the filing. \n\n\u201cThe only way the USOPC will agree to\u201d the settlement \u201cis if it is protected by the release and injunctions described\u201d in the agreement. \nThe proposed settlement, an attorney for USA Gymnastics wrote in the filing, \u201cis in the best interests of, and provides the highest and most expeditious recovery to, all parties who hold claims\u201d against the organization. \n\nThe disclose statement outlines how the survivors would be broken up into four groups. Women who were sexually abused by Nassar at the Olympics, Worlds, national team training camps or other national team events would receive $1,250,757 each. Simone Biles, the four-time Olympic and 19-time World champion, and all five members of the record setting 2012 Olympic gold medal-winning team said they were abused by Nassar while they represented the U.S. at the Olympic Games, World Championships and other major international competitions as well as national team training camps at the Karolyi Ranch in Central Texas. \n\nNon-elite gymnasts sexually abused at USA Gymnastics-sanctioned events would receive $508,670 each. Individuals abused at non-USA Gymnastics locations would receive $174,401 each and individuals with \u201cderivative claims\u201d $82,550 each. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear for parents considering putting your child in a gym sanctioned by USA Gymnastics what USA Gymnastics is saying if we place a known pedophile in that gym and that individual rapes your child then your child is worth $82,000,\u201d said John Manly, an attorney for dozens of Nassar survivors. \u201cMy client Rachael Denhollander asked what is a little girl worth. Apparently if you\u2019re raped by the national team doctor you\u2019re worth $82,000 to USA Gymnastics. \n\n\u201cThis is the most disgusting, reprehensible, vile view of children I can imagine. And for (USA Gymnastics) to put this out there and act like it is a constructive step shows how out of touch they are. Steve Penny was so bad USA Gymnastics banned him for life, the Karolyis, every one of them, and they pay nothing. They have no consequences. What message does that send to the next Steve Penny? The message is you get off scot free. You\u2019re better off putting your kids in roller derby.\u201d \n\n Under the heading \u201cnon-monetary commitments and reforms\u201d USA Gymnastics states in the filing that \u201cin addition to compensating survivors\u2026USAG is committed to taking concrete action to address concerns that survivors and others have raised about the organization and its culture.\u201d But neither the disclosure statement or a reorganization plan filed with the bankruptcy court last month make any mention of USA Gymnastics disclosing documents or information that would reveal the organization\u2019s role and that of others in creating the culture of abuse within the sport that enabled Nassar\u2019s abuse. \n\nUSA Gymnastics in the disclosure statement does assert that the organization has made \u201csignificant progress\u201d in taking steps to prevent future abuse. The filing states that \u201cone of the most significant changes USAG made during the case was its decision to hire Li Li Leung\u201d as the organization\u2019s CEO last year. \n\nLeung receives $450,000 in annual compensation and as much as $90,000 annual in bonuses, according to financial records and court filings. \n\nUSA Gymnastics is facing hundreds of lawsuits across the country that allege the organization and its top officials and coaches fostered a culture of abuse that enabled the predatory behavior of Nassar and other coaches and officials, and then, in consultation with U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and FBI officials, attempted to conceal that sexual abuse from the public. \n\nUSA Gymnastics filed for protection under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy for the Southern District of Indiana in December 2018. \n\nThat Chapter 11 filing prompted an automatic stay on all legal proceedings and litigation, including discovery, against USA Gymnastics, and the USOPC\u2019s efforts to strip the organization of its national governing body status. \n\nThe USOPC has not said if it proceed with the decertification process, should a settlement be reached. \n\nThe proposal comes after months of talks between attorneys for USA Gymnastics and the hundreds of Nassar survivors have stalled with the two sides still hundreds of millions of dollars apart. It also follows a motion filed by attorneys for the survivors in January asking the bankruptcy court to dismiss USA Gymnastics\u2019 bid for Chapter 11 protection. \n\n\u201cUSAG\/USOC, and its revolving door of executives since, have done everything in their collective power to conceal the truth from Nassar\u2019s hundreds of survivors, the more than 100 survivors of abuse suffered at the hands of coaches over the past several decades, law enforcement authorities, and the American public,\u201d James I. Stang, an attorney for a committee representing survivor wrote in the January filing. \u201cThe coordinated strategy of USAG and the USOC was, and remains to be, to delay, deflect and deny them and non-Nassar survivors justice for the horrible crimes committed upon them as children. Sadly, USAG and the USOC have used this bankruptcy proceeding as yet another tool to inflict pain upon these sexual abuse survivors \u2013 both Nassar and non-Nassar survivors \u2013 and to deny justice to these girls and women who competed for this institution and their country.\u201d \n\nUnder the reorganization plan, USA Gymnastics proposes two options of for sexual abuse survivors: accept $215 million to settle all claims or continue to pursue judgments in civil suits from insurance policies available to the organization. \n\nIf the survivors vote to accept the settlement, the insurers for a Michigan gym owned by the family of former U.S. Olympic coach John Geddert would also contribute an additional $2.125 million to the settlement amount. Nassar routinely treated young athletes at the gym, Twistars, located near Lansing. \n\nUSA Gymnastics\u2019 proposed settlement is less than half the $500 million settlement Michigan State reached with survivors of sexual abuse by Nassar, a former member of the Michigan State sports medicine staff. \n\nNassar is serving a\u00a060-year federal prison sentence\u00a0on child pornography charges. He was also sentenced in Ingham County, Michigan, last January to 40 to 175 years for child sexual assault and 40-125 years in Eaton County, Michigan, on similar charges in February. \n\nPenny was first informed of Nassar\u2019s sexual abuse of U.S. national team member Maggie Nichols in June 2015. In the following weeks Penny was also informed that Olympic champions Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney had also likely been sexually assaulted by Nassar. Yet Penny kept the abuse hidden from the public until September 2016, working with FBI agents in the bureau\u2019s Indianapolis office, other USA Gymnastics officials and board members, as well as an attorney for the organization, according to\u00a0documents obtained by the Southern California News Group. \n\nNassar, according to court documents, sexually abused at least 40 young athletes between Penny\u2019s first contact with the FBI agent in charge of the bureau\u2019s Indianapolis office in July 2015 and September 2016, when Nassar\u2019s abuse became public. The number of victims in that window could actually surpass 100, according to persons familiar with dozens of Nassar-related lawsuits. \n\nNassar was allowed to retire as U.S. national team coach in September 2015 without he or USA Gymnastics describing the reason behind his departure. \n\nPenny was arrested in October 2018 after a Texas grand jury indicted him on felony evidence tampering charges. The indictment alleges Penny ordered the removal of documents from the Karolyi Ranch related to Nassar\u2019s activities. \n\n\u201cThe indictment further\u00a0alleges that\u00a0the removal of the documents\u00a0was done for the purpose of impairing the ongoing investigation by destroying or hiding\u00a0the\u00a0documents,\u201d according to the Walker County, Texas District Attorney\u2019s office. \n\nPenny was fired as USA Gymnastics CEO and president in March 2017 under pressure from the USOPC. He has denied any wrongdoing. \n\nFaehn, then USA Gymnastics senior vice president for its women\u2019s program, was informed of concerns about Nassar\u2019s procedures on June 17, 2015 by Sarah Jantzi, Maggie Nichols\u2019 club coach. Jantzi told Faehn that Nichols described \u201cthree uncomfortable encounters of therapy with Nassar\u201d\u00a0 including massaging her groin area \u201ctoo close to the vagina.\u201d \n\nFaehn reported the call to Penny that day. It would be weeks, however, before Penny and other USA Gymnastics officials contacted the FBI about Nassar. Faehn was forced out at USA Gymnastics in May 2018. \n\n\u201cUnbelievably painful\u2026 total disregard for the athletes that were used, abused, and now swept to the side!\u201d John Nichols, Maggie\u2019s father, wrote on twitter Friday night after the Orange County Register first posted details from the disclosure statement. \n\nWhite, the USA Gymnastics national teams manager, on Penny\u2019s orders removed several boxes of medical records and other documents relevant to the Larry Nassar investigation from the Karolyi Ranch in November 2016, according to Faehn in a sworn deposition. \n\nFaehn said in the deposition that White in March confided to her that Penny called her and told her to remove records from the Karolyi Ranch and transport them to USA Gymnastics headquarters in Indianapolis. \n\nWhite told Faehn that after returning to the headquarters \u201cshe gave them to Steve Penny,\u201d Faehn said referring to the medical records. \n\nPeters, the coach of the groundbreaking 1984 U.S. Olympic women\u2019s team, was banned for life by USA Gymnastics in 2011 following a Register investigation that reported he had sex with three teenage gymnasts. \n\n\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0 \n  \n\t\t\t"},"5":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tCaltrans identifies sites, many near freeways, for emergency homeless shelters\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/caltrans-identifies-sites-many-near-freeways-for-emergency-homeless-shelters\/","discription":"\nSmall, undeveloped pieces of Caltrans property near freeway ramps and interchanges account for all but one of nine state-owned sites in Orange County identified Friday as spots where emergency shelters could be placed.\nThe one exception: the state-owned Fairview Developmental Center in Costa Mesa, where earlier this month only two residents remained in the cluster of buildings designed to hold hundreds of people with developmental and intellectual disabilities.\nIn a Feb. 21 news release to accompany the \n\u201cThe state is stepping up by making land available to cities and counties willing to meet this moment head-on,\u201d Newsom is quoted in the release.

It mandates that block grant recipients push for community engagement and examine the instructional, school climate and other factors that have led to low student achievement.\nThe resolution additionally calls for moving away from punitive school discipline practices and the issuance of state guidelines to reduce racially disproportionate discipline.\nThe case was named for \u201cElla T.,\u201d one of 10 students from Los Angeles, Inglewood and Stockton who were listed along with two advocacy organizations as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\nLos Angeles Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner released a statement in response to the settlement, saying reading is \u201cthe foundation of learning.\u201d\nHe said the resolution \u201cis a step in the right direction, but only a small step\u201d in the search for improving literacy.\n\u201cA generation ago, California\u2019s public education system led the nation with well-funded schools serving the needs of the entire community and great student outcomes,\u201d Beutner said. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s no longer the case. School funding is not stable or adequate and achievement is lagging. Per-pupil funding in Los Angeles has fallen relative to other parts of the country and is now 40% less than in New York.\u201d\nYet, last year there were record-high graduation rates, record-low suspension rates and increases across the board in student achievement, all of which demonstrate that progress is being made, Beutner said.\n\u201cThere is talent in every seat in every classroom in every one of the 1\nPlaintiff\u2019s attorney Mark Rosenbaum of the Public Counsel law firm said the most urgent struggle for social justice in the U.S. has been access to literacy.\n\u201cThe right to read is not just the cornerstone of education, it is the cornerstone of our democracy,\u201d Rosenbaum said. \u201cWithout it, we continue to build a future on the illusion that the \u2018haves\u2019 compete on the same terms with the \u2018have nots.\u201d\u2018\nErik Olson, another plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, said the settlement is \u201ca tremendous victory for the courageous families and community leaders who demanded that the state of California fulfill its obligation to provide every child the opportunity to learn to read.\u201d"},"8":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tInstead of another gated community, Porter Ranch and Chatsworth get 257 acres of lovely, preserved open space\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/instead-of-another-gated-community-porter-ranch-and-chatsworth-get-257-acres-of-lovely-preserved-open-space\/","discription":"\nIt was once slated to become yet another suburban gated community with a bucolic name in the northern reaches of Porter Ranch and Chatsworth.\nBut on Friday, there was little doubt that the 257-acre swath of hills near the Aliso Canyon Gas Storage Facility was to remain what it has long been \u2014 the home of the oaks, mountain lions, southern spotted owla and other flora and fauna.\nA blessing ceremony by the Tataviam tribe marked the occasion, a dedication of the new parkland attended by state and county officials who had pooled their resources to buy the property last November from a developer that wanted to build a gated community of 188 luxury homes on that land.\nThe housing development was to be called Hidden Creeks Estates.

SISAK\nNEW YORK \u2014 Jurors deliberating in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape trial indicated Friday that they are deadlocked on the most serious charges, but the judge told them to keep trying.\nIn a note sent to the judge during their lunch break, jurors asked if it were permissible for them to be hung on two counts of predatory sexual assault while reaching a unanimous verdict on other charges.\nAfter consulting with prosecutors and Weinstein\u2019s lawyers, Judge James Burke told the jury of seven men and five women to keep working toward a unanimous verdict on all charges and sent them back to continue deliberating Shortly thereafter, the judge sent the jury home for the day. Deliberations will resume Monday.\nWeinstein\u2019s lawyers said they would accept a partial verdict, but prosecutors said no and Burke refused to allow it.\nThe jury, in its fourth day of deliberations, has been particularly focused on the key aspect of two counts of predatory sexual assault: \u201cSopranos\u201d actress Annabella Sciorra\u2019s allegations that Weinstein raped and forcibly performed oral sex on her in the mid-1990s. Those charges carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.\nIn all, Weinstein, 67, is charged with five counts stemming from the allegations of Sciorra and two other women \u2014 an aspiring actress who says he raped her in March 2013 and a former film and TV production assistant, Mimi Haleyi, who says he forcibly performed oral sex on her in March 2006.\nTo convict Weinstein of a predatory sexual assault charge, jurors must agree on two things: that Weinstein raped or sexually assaulted Sciorra and that he committed one of the other charged offenses. The predatory sexual assault charge requires prosecutors to show that a defendant committed a prior rape or other sex crime, but doesn\u2019t have the statue of limitation constraints that would bar Sciorra\u2019s allegations from consideration on their own.\nWeinstein has maintained any sexual encounters were consensual.\nThe Associated Press has a policy of not publishing the names of people who allege sexual assault without their consent. It is withholding the name of the 2013 rape accuser because it isn\u2019t clear whether she wishes to be identified publicly.\nJurors started the day Friday by listening to a reading of Sciorra\u2019s cross-examination and follow-up questioning by prosecutors. About 90 minutes into the reading, the jurors notified the judge they had \u201cheard enough\u201d and resumed their deliberations.\nSciorra testified nearly a month ago. She was the first accuser to do so in the closely watched #MeToo trial.\nThe jury has already focused on emails that Weinstein sent regarding Sciorra, including ones to the private Israeli spy agency he allegedly enlisted to dig up dirt on would-be accusers as reporters were working on stories about allegations against him in 2017.\nSciorra, now 59, told jurors how the once-powerful movie mogul showed up unexpectedly at the door of her Manhattan apartment before barging in and raping and forcibly performing oral sex on her in late 1993 or early 1994.\nOn cross-examination, Sciorra was grilled about why she opened her door in the first place and didn\u2019t find a way to escape if she was under attack.\nWeinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno asked: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you try to run out of the apartment? Did you scratch him? Try to poke him in the eyes?\u201d\nProsecutors say Sciorra weighed only about 110 pounds (50 kilograms) in those days, making her no match for the 300-pound (135-kilogram) Weinstein.\n\u201cHe was too big\u201d to fight off, she told the jury. \u201cHe was frightening.\u201d\nSciorra went public in a story in The New Yorker in October 2017 after one of the few people she says she told about the incident, actress Rosie Perez, got word to reporter Ronan Farrow that he should call her.\nSciorra didn\u2019t get involved in the criminal case until later. Her allegations weren\u2019t part of the original indictment when Weinstein was arrested in May 2018, but after some legal shuffling they were included in an updated one last August.\nWeinstein\u2019s lawyers fought to get her nixed from the case in the run-up to the trial, arguing to no avail that prosecutors shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use her claims because they predated the enactment of the predatory sexual assault charge in 2006.\nWeinstein\u2019s lawyers have also argued that it\u2019s plainly unfair to make the producer defend himself against something alleged to have happened more than a quarter-century ago. They contend prosecutors shoehorned Sciorra into the case to get a marquee name on the witness stand.\n\u201cAnnabella was brought into this case for one reason and one reason only,\u201d Rotunno said in her closing argument last week. \u201cShe was brought in so there would be one witness who had some star power, one witness you may recognize and one witness whose name may mean something.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"},"12":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tU.S.: Taliban\u2019s \u2018reduction of violence\u2019 deal to start tonight, culminating with peace pact signing\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/us-talibans-reduction-of-violence-deal-to-start-tonight\/","discription":"\nBy KATHY GANNON and MATTHEW LEE\nISLAMABAD \u2014 The seven-day \u201creduction of violence\u201d deal promised by the Taliban will begin on Friday night, a senior U.S. State Department official said, without specifying the exact time.
