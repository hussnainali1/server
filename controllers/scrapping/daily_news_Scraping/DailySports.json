(AP Photo\/Alonzo Adams)\n \n \nBEVERLY HILLS >> In a backstage in a dressing room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, an hour before the annual L.A. Sports Awards, Rachel Garcia was surrounded by family and friends. She wore a black dress with see-through sleeves and nude-colored heels \u2014 an outfit she had a friend approve of in advance. \n\nA makeup artist asked her to pull up the end of her dress a couple inches and began rubbing tinted lotion on her leg to prepare her for being on camera. Garcia looked confused. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t do this often, do you?\u201d \n\nThrough all the accolades, including Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year and most recently receiving the 2019 LA Sportswoman of the Year award by the Los Angeles Sports Council on Thursday, and all the media appearances over the past eight months, Garcia is still not used to all this. \n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, this whole thing is not really my style,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cDressing up is very hard for me.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s been a non-stop rollercoaster ride of emotional experiences for the UCLA softball pitcher. After leading the Bruins to the program\u2019s 13th national championship in June, Garcia\u2019s childhood dreams came true in October when she made the U.S. Olympic team for this summer\u2019s 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. \n\nWhile the Palmdale native is learning what it takes to compete on the biggest stage, she understands this opportunity will forever impact the sport\u2019s future, especially with the next stop on the ride being a collision of her two softball worlds in a Sunday exhibition game between Team USA and UCLA at \n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s never ending,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel a little overwhelmed not gonna lie. It\u2019s a lot of stuff coming at me at once. I\u2019m just super honored and humbled with what softball has provided me, just to be here to represent softball means the world to me right now.\u201d \n\nSunday\u2019s game is just one stop on Team USA\u2019s 66-game, 35-city \u2018Stand Beside Her\u2019 tour in which the U.S. will play various collegiate, professional and top club teams in preparation for the Olympics. Six Pac-12 schools, including UCLA and Arizona (which Team USA beat 5-4 on Feb. 18), will get the chance to face off against the Red, White and Blue. \nWhile the cross-country traveling and lack of school work \u2014 Garcia is redshirting this season with UCLA for a final year of collegiate eligibility in 2021 \u2014 are big perks of playing on the national team, Garcia said she\u2019s had to get used to being more self-disciplined in the training room. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a grind and you have to be motivated internally,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the mentality of when you don\u2019t have someone telling you what to do, you have to be prepared. Like in the weight room, you step into the weight room and you don\u2019t have a coach telling you what to do. [You have to] be prepared, come up with your own workouts.\u201d \n\nThis summer marks the return of softball to the Olympics after being cut following the 2008 summer games in Beijing. The opportunity to be a part of the sport\u2019s Olympic revival is something Garcia doesn\u2019t take lightly as she knows it\u2019s creating something powerful for future generations. \n\n\u201cWhen it got taken out, it was devastating,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cIt felt like it crushed a lot of little girls\u2019 hearts just like mine. But now that we have this opportunity, I\u2019m just super honored and humbled to be a part of this 2020 journey and just be among some of the best female athletes in this sport and to be that inspiration for the next group of girls.\u201d \n\nGarcia is looking forward to facing the Bruins come Sunday. Through all the crazy madness that has been her life as of late, it\u2019s the support of her teammates and UCLA coaches that has meant the most to her. \n\n\u201cThey have my back just as I have theirs,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing able to hear from them that they are excited for me to be a part of this, to expand the sport of softball, that was probably the best moment.\u201d \n\n\n\nSunday, 11:30 a.m. \n\n Big League Dreams Sports Park in Cathedral City, Calif. in the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic \n\n Flosoftball \n  \n\t\t\t"},"2":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tWhicker: Will the last cut be the deepest for Fury against Wilder?\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/whicker-will-the-last-cut-be-the-deepest-for-fury-against-wilder\/","discription":"\nLAS VEGAS >> Tyson Fury got through 12 rounds against Deontay Wilder with skin and smile unbroken. \n\nHe couldn\u2019t get through three rounds against Otto Wallin without a cut that bled badly enough for sandbags. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThere were two cuts, actually, one over the right eye and one inside the eyelid. They needed 47 stitches and plastic surgery and on Saturday night they serve as a big \u201cHit One Here\u201d sign, like the ones that used to be on baseball scoreboards, for Wilder in the WBC heavyweight champion rematch. \n\nA break in the levee could quickly dampen this occasion, which has whipped up a hype-storm worthy of\u00a0 Floyd Mayweather days. It is a straight-up even fight between two undefeated heavyweights who already have given us one shining moment, over 14 months ago, at Staples Center. \nFury and Wilder carried true malice into that fight, probably because Wilder did not take Fury seriously, probably because Fury was literally coming down from 400 pounds of body weight and maybe 800 pounds of depression and addiction. Fury then won more rounds than Wilder but had to accept a draw. \n\nNow it\u2019s theatre. Fury and Wilder yell at each other like Willy Loman\u2019s sons. Fortunately, nobody on this stage yells, \u201cCut!\u201d \n\n\u201cI was gone from the ring for three years and you still couldn\u2019t knock me out,\u201d Fury told Wilder at close range on Wednesday, before they pushed each other and were separated. Both were play-acting but the promoters are taking no chances. There was no staredown at Friday\u2019s weigh-in. \n\nFury has taken to calling Wilder \u201ca big dosser,\u201d\u00a0 which is British slang for \u201cbag lady.\u201d His marketing touch has even produced a sport coat with \u201cYou Big Dosser\u201d in vertical rows. \n\nThat might not become a fashion staple. But Fury is firing all guns at once this weekend. He knows his career changes dramatically no matter the outcome. \nHe is not pretending that the cut didn\u2019t exist or won\u2019t matter. Perhaps that is why Fury keeps bringing up a second-round knockout. He knows scar tissue does not have a long shelf life against Wilder \n\n\u201cHe can try to back me up,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cBut can he do it, and if he does do it, how long can he continue? I don\u2019t get credit for a lot of things. But one thing is for sure. I\u2019m a great fighter going on my back feet. That\u2019s when I can time you and set you up and run you into my own traps.\u201d \n\nWallin, 29, was 20-0 before Fury. For a second, he thought 21-0 was in the bag. But referee Tony Weeks and the ring doctors kept running Fury out there, and the Gypsy King won a unanimous decision (four, five and six points on the judges\u2019 cards). Through the blood, Fury dubbed Wallin, from Sweden, \u201cthe Viking warrior.\u201d \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll watch the tape, I hit him, I saw the cut, and then I looked at my corner and said, \u2018Yeah!\u2019\u2019\u2019 Wallin said, pumping his fist. \n\n\u201cIt was a bad cut. In my mind the fight should have been stopped. But Fury is a warrior and he kept coming. There\u2019s no way he was going to quit.\u201d \n\nNo, especially not with Wilder and a treasure chest over the next hill. There are disinterested parties who think the doctors would have retired Fury in a normal situation. \n\n\u201cHe (Fury) will have the cut on his mind,\u201d Wallin said. \u201cHe also knows he got knocked down in the first fight. But I do think it would be a mistake for Wilder to target that cut. Fury has a lot of head movement and he\u2019s a good counterpuncher. What Wilder probably should do is go to the body. And then they will adapt.\u201d \n\nBut \u201cthey\u201d is different in this fight. Ben Davison was a Trainer of the Year candidate for the way he reshaped Fury the first time. Davison is gone. Fury said he wanted a more aggressive game plan but it didn\u2019t help when Davison\u2019s corner had trouble coagulating. \n\nThe new trainer is SugarHill Steward, the nephew of the legendary trainer Emanuel. Actually his name was Javan \u201cSugar\u201d Hill but he changed it because he said Emanuel was more of a father figure. \n\nWilder interprets all this as a seed of turmoil. \n\n\u201cYou see a lot of nervous energy in his camp,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cHe has a lot of things going on. He\u2019s changing up so many things. You already know the saying. If it\u2019s not broken, why fix it?\u201d \n\n\u201cI think Fury has more tools to work with,\u201d Wallin said. \u201cHe\u2019s a more versatile fighter. Wilder was impressive when he used to throw that jab, especially against Bermane Stiverne. But he hasn\u2019t done it much lately. So let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d \n\nMore to the point, let\u2019s see what Fury can see. \n  \n\t\t\t"},"3":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tUCLA men face Colorado for potential tiebreaker in Pac-12 standings\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/ucla-men-face-colorado-for-potential-tiebreaker-in-pac-12-standings\/","discription":"\nThe Bruins have finally become the defensive team Coach Mick Cronin has been striving to turn them into all season. And it\u2019s showing. \n\nAt Utah on Thursday, UCLA prevented the Utes from making a 3-pointer until halfway through the second half, and Utah ended the game 3 for 12 from beyond the arc for its second-worst performance from distance during Pac-12 play this season. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u201cDefensively, we couldn\u2019t have played much better,\u201d Cronin told reporters following \nUCLA is riding high, having won four in a row and eight of its last 10. In those eight wins, the Bruins have held opponents to an average of 59.1 points per game, improving their record to 15-0 when holding opposing teams to 73 points or fewer. \n\u201cWe haven\u2019t changed anything,\u201d sophomore guard David Singleton said at Thursday\u2019s post-game press conference. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing it better. We got used to Cronin\u2019s style. To be honest, we started playing harder. We\u2019re putting in more effort on defense, every game.\u201d \n\nWith its final out-of-state away game on Saturday afternoon at No. 18 Colorado, the Bruins (16-11, 9-5 Pac-12) are looking for their longest win streak of the season. \n\nA win over the Buffaloes would not only be UCLA\u2019s first in Boulder since 2017, but securing the season sweep over Colorado would also give the Bruins the tiebreaker if the teams were to finish conference play with the same record. UCLA is tied with Oregon for fourth in the conference standings but sit just one game behind first-place Colorado (21-6, 10-4) with Arizona and Arizona State tied for second at 9-4 in Pac-12 play. The top four teams in the final standings get byes into the quarterfinals of next month\u2019s Pac-12 Tournament in Las Vegas. \n\nSince its previous loss to UCLA, Colorado has won five of its last six games with its only loss coming against then-No.\u00a017 Oregon 68-60 in Eugene. \n\nThe Buffaloes are led by junior guards McKinley Wright (13.6 ppg) and Tyler Bey (13.5 ppg). Bey also leads the team and is tied atop the Pac-12 with 9.3 rebounds per game. \nThe Bruins upset then-No. 20 Colorado 72-68 on Jan. 30 at Pauley Pavilion. Junior guard Chris Smith had a career-high 30 points in the program\u2019s first win against a ranked team since Feb. 8, 2018. UCLA had a season-low eight assists but shot a season-best 86.2 from the free-throw line. \n\n Saturday, 1 p.m. \n\n Boulder, Colo. \n\n CBS\/Ch.\u00a02, 1150\u00a0AM \n  \n\t\t\t"},"4":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tLife for a lefty specialist like Dodgers\u2019 Adam Kolarek could be changing this year\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/life-for-a-lefty-specialist-like-adam-kolarek-could-be-changing-this-year\/","discription":"\nGLENDALE, Ariz. \u2014 When they came for the LOOGYs this winter, Adam Kolarek didn\u2019t worry about it. He\u2019s never seen himself that way. \n\n\u201cWhen it was brought up last year, I kind of knew it was something that was going to be happening. Even in Triple-A, I figured it was going to happen. I just assumed it was already passed,\u201d Kolarek said of the recently-ratified rule change which will require relief pitchers entering the game to face a minimum of three batters or complete an inning. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u201cI think the main thing I\u2019ve been telling people is until I came to L.A., I never thought of myself as a one-hitter guy. I was never used that way.\u201d \n\nHe was used that way by the Dodgers after being acquired from the Tampa Bay Rays in a midseason trade. Kolarek faced just one batter in 16 of his 26 appearances with the Dodgers in 2019 and two or fewer in 20 of the 26. In the postseason, he made three appearances against the Washington Nationals, faced left-handed Juan Soto each time and struck him out twice. \nLife as a LOOGY \u2013 the baseball acronym for Left-handed One-Out Guy \u2013 had its good points for Kolarek. \n\n\u201cI enjoyed being available every night,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew looking at the lineup every night who I needed to prepare for mentally. \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be an adjustment for everybody.\u201d \n\nIn his career, Kolarek has held left-handed hitters to a .199 average with just 10 extra-base hits and only two home runs in 181 plate appearances. Despite his funky, sidearm delivery, right-handed hitters have been a lot more successful \u2013 a .299 average and .849 OPS. But Kolarek believes he has the weapons to get them out as well. \n\n\u201cThe main thing is I\u2019ve always been a ground ball pitcher so I have to attack from the get-go,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the batting average against righties is a little higher than it is against lefties. But as long as I\u2019m keeping it on the ground eventually that ball is going to be at somebody.\u201d \nDodgers manager Dave Roberts said the new rule has the Dodgers looking at ways to sequence pitches from a \u201clefty killer\u201d like Kolarek \u2013 and a \u201crighty\u201d killer like Dylan Floro \u2013 to make them more effective against the opposite-handed batter. \n\n\u201cAdam has been a lefty killer throughout his entire career. Now with the rule change, the challenge for him is to be able to feel confident in getting out a right-handed hitter,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cNow it\u2019s kind of, \u2018How do I attack right-handed hitters?\u2019 \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give him every opportunity to face right-hand hitters to kind of see how that plays out, but I have every confidence that Adam will figure some things out and be effective against the right-handed hitter.\u201d \n\nHe wasn\u2019t scheduled to throw a bullpen session on Friday. But Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen spent a good deal of time during the workout surrounded by instructors Rick Honeycutt, Joel Peralta and Orel Hershiser, throwing off a mound. \n\n\u201cIt happened you guys were there instead of watching David Price throw live BP,\u201d Jansen teased with reporters afterward. \u201cIf you guys were watching David Price throw live BP, you probably wouldn\u2019t know I was there.\u201d \n\nJansen\u2019s work was focused on his slider. He said he tried three different grips during the session, finally finding a comfort level with one suggested by Hershiser and Honeycutt. \n\n\u201cThis is the perfect time to work on it,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cWhy not take advantage of having those guys around?\u201d \n\nRoberts said he has talked with Mookie Betts about where the new Dodger feels most comfortable batting in the lineup and Betts is expected to be the primary leadoff hitter this year. He could slip down to No.\u00ad\u00a02 against right-handed pitching, allowing Joc Pederson to bat leadoff. With the new three-batter minimum rule in place this year, opposing teams will have to think long and hard about bringing in a lefty specialist to face Pederson if it means leaving the lefty in to then face Betts and possibly Justin Turner. \n\n\u201cMookie has talked to me about wanting to hit at the top,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThat\u2019s where he feels comfortable and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now.\u201d \n\nBetts batted first or second in all of his 148 starts for the Red Sox last season and has highest OPS (.910) as a leadoff hitter in his career. \n  \n\t\t\t"},"5":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tSierra Canyon basketball defeats Etiwanda to reach third straight Open Division final\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/sierra-canyon-basketball-headed-to-third-straight-open-division-final-after-defeating-etiwanda\/","discription":"\nSupport our high school sports coverage by becoming a digital subscriber. \n When Sierra Canyon and Etiwanda faced each other on Dec. 28 in the Classic at Damien, it was anticipated to be a potential Open Division matchup.

(Photo by Hans Gutknecht, Los Angeles Daily News\/SCNG)\n \n \n\u201cThe delay really stopped our momentum,\u201d Etiwanda\u2019s Jaylen Clark said. \u201cThat was tough.\u201d \n\nEtiwanda cut Sierra Canyon\u2019s lead to 55-49 in the fourth quarter, but a corner 3-pointer from Bronny James in front of the Sierra Canyon bench ballooned the lead back to nine. \n\n\u201cThat was a huge shot,\u201d Sierra Canyon coach Andre Chevalier said. \n\nClark had 10 first-quarter points, including a corner 3-pointer that gave Etiwanda a 14-6 lead in front of its rambunctious traveling crowd. But Sierra Canyon used a 9-0 run to retake the lead behind transition baskets from Amari Bailey. \nAfter one tough finish, Bailey immediately began to chirp at the Etiwanda bench. A few possessions later Clark returned the favor with a tough finish of his own. \n\nClark, a transfer from Corona Centennial who didn\u2019t play in December\u2019s first meeting, scored a game-high 32 points. \n\n\u201cThis was a great game,\u201d Clark said. \u201cSierra Canyon was a great team. We still have more basketball to play. I\u2019ll put this one behind me and move on.\u201d \n\nEtiwanda made four 3s in the first half that helped the Eagles to a 34-31 lead a halftime, but those made 3s was something Sierra Canyon knew Etiwanda wasn\u2019t particularly great at. \n\n\u201cWhen they made those shots early, we knew it wouldn\u2019t last,\u201d Sierra Canyon\u2019s Ziaire Williams said. \u201cBut it was harder for us to get in transition when they\u2019re making shots. In the second half, they started missing those same shots and we were able to get out in transition.\u201d \n\nWilliams scored 23 points in the game, another high-level recruit who was unable to play in December\u2019s victory over Etiwanda due to the transfer sit-out period. \n\nIt\u2019s the biggest game he\u2019s played in his high school career after transferring from Notre Dame Sherman Oaks \u2013 which never got further than the second round in his three years there. \n\n\u201cThe game was crazy, but I just prepare like any other game,\u201d Williams said. \n\nIn the third quarter, only three Sierra Canyon players scored: Williams, Amari Bailey and BJ Boston. Boston totaled 19 and Bailey finished with 18. \n\n\u201cEven when they were making shots, we stuck to the game plan,\u201d Bailey said. \n"},"6":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tLakers squander big lead before putting away Grizzlies in return from break\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/lakers-squander-big-lead-before-putting-away-grizzlies-in-return-from-break\/","discription":"\n \nLakers forward LeBron James, right, passes while under pressure from Grizzlies guard Dillon Brooks during the first half of Friday\u2019s game at Staples Center.

(Photo by Katelyn Mulcahy\/Getty Images)\n \n \nLOS ANGELES \u2014 If the season ended today, the Lakers and Grizzlies would be pitted in a first-round playoff series. The Lakers\u2019 3-0 season record against their challenger doesn\u2019t inspire much hope for a competitive affair if it comes to fruition in April. \n\nBut Friday night\u2019s game, a 117-105 Lakers win at Staples Center, provided a snapshot of what Memphis (28-28) might offer in that potential 1-vs.-8 matchup \u2013 not experience, but energy. And the Lakers (42-12), who seemed perhaps a little too cool back from their All-Star break, need to bring some in return. \n\nThe Lakers were up by 25 early in the third quarter, on their way to an apparent blowout, but the Grizzlies whittled that to as few as four points in a tighter-than-hoped fourth. It forced LeBron James (32 points, 10 for 11 from the free-throw line) and Anthony Davis (28 points) to play deep into a game when they might have otherwise been able to watch from the bench and forced the Lakers to find the gear they were on before their time off last week. \n\nTo say the result was in doubt might be an overstatement \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t completely assured until James scored back-to-back baskets within the final two minutes: a tough layup in traffic and a turnaround baseline jumper. On the next possession, Davis made a 3-pointer and held his hands high on the follow-through while exhaling with relief. \nThe Lakers are likely to need tougher resolve as soon as Sunday, with an afternoon game scheduled against the Boston Celtics (39-16) who stomped them back in January. \n\n\u201cThe worst loss of the season for us, we didn\u2019t play our best at all,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSo we remember that for sure. We feel like we owe them.\u201d \n\nJames and Davis, who had the least time off because of their All-Star weekend obligations, looked the most like themselves. James was the main force in gathering up the early lead, including a memorable first-quarter dunk off a Danny Green lob. \n\nDavis might have made his biggest impact on defense, where he racked up seven blocked shots, frustrating Grizzlies drivers for much of the night. He also worked the glass for 13 rebounds on a night when the Lakers\u2019 traditional centers struggled to make an impact with foul trouble. He scored 24 of his 28 points, grabbed 11 of his 13 rebounds and blocked five of his seven shots in the second half. \n\nIt drummed up more talk from the Lakers that Davis should be the front-runner for Defensive Player of the Year, which Davis acknowledged is part of his motivation \u2013 but not all. \n\u201cI would love to have that award several times before I retire \u2013 which is not soon,\u201d he quipped. \u201cBut I think just trying to set a standard for one myself and two, my team on the defensive end and the rest of the guys will follow and I\u2019m just trying to help guys on their beat.\u201d \n\nThe Grizzlies\u2019 effort came on a night when the Lakers effectively corralled their rookie star Ja Morant, holding the springy dunker to 17 points (5-for-14 shooting) and three assists. The franchise\u2019s other young pillar, Jaren Jackson Jr., left the game with left knee soreness after just 16 minutes of play. \n\nBut the Lakers\u2019 own attack looked unsteady against Memphis\u2019 determined defense: They shot only 3 for 11 from 3-point range after halftime. The exceptions were Avery Bradley (14 points) and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (12 points). Alex Caruso gave the Lakers a two-way boost in the closing lineup, adding nine points including a putback dunk of a missed free throw over a helpless Kyle Anderson. \n\nA recent rotation change has Caruso (nine points) playing more minutes late in the second and fourth quarters in the Lakers\u2019 closing group. Statistics indicate that he\u2019s one of James\u2019 best partners. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the eye test, but LeBron and Alex is one of our best combinations throughout the season from a net rating standpoint,\u201d Coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to explore ways that that\u2019s getting out there enough without overdoing it. The last two games he\u2019s just been playing out of his mind.\u201d \n\nThe Lakers had a brief scare in the first quarter, when Davis took a knee in the back of his right calf from one of the Memphis players. He subbed out of the game in the first minute, then headed to the locker room after the first timeout. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the 8:48 mark of the second quarter that Davis strode back onto the bench, then quickly checked back in. He ended up playing 31 minutes. \n\nDavis said he felt pain in the calf when he was sitting, but as he played, he got warmer and felt better. \n\n\u201cIf guys can\u2019t go, it\u2019s next-man-up mentality, and I think we did that tonight when I went out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t, if guys feel like they\u2019re able to play, then, by all means, we\u2019re going to be on the floor. We\u2019re trying to set a culture, set a standard for ourselves that is going to get us into a rhythm heading into the playoffs.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s the goal, which Vogel emphasized again on Friday. The Lakers are on pace to earn the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference, and their priorities will start shifting to maintaining health and rhythm in the final run of the regular season. \n\nSo yes, he acknowledged, potential playoff matchups like the Grizzlies are \u201cin the back of our minds,\u201d but first things come first. \n\n\u201cThe answers reveal themselves after the fact,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not thinking about playoffs tonight. We\u2019re thinking about getting one win.\u201d \n\n.\n\u2014 Spectrum SportsNet (@SpectrumSN) \n\n\n\"They're both just winning players.

Then he sat inside under the locker bearing his last name. While he has not played this season since tearing his left ACL, Cousins has been a consistent presence around the team \u2013 even on trips. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIt\u2019s likely one of the last such days Cousins will have this season as a Laker: Multiple media reports indicate the team is making a move in the buyout market, intending to add forward Markieff Morris if he clears waivers on Sunday, and waiving Cousins to create the necessary roster spot. \n\nThe Athletic reported that Morris was entering the market after agreeing to a buyout with the Detroit Pistons on Friday. ESPN was first to report that Cousins, a former All-Star who was injured in August, would be cut to make room for an addition the Lakers hope can bolster their frontcourt for the postseason. \nThe Lakers declined to officially comment, with Coach Frank Vogel saying: \u201cI don\u2019t have any comment about rumors or reports.\u201d \n\nMorris is the latest chess move as Western Conference contenders have worked to improve their rosters for the playoffs, but it\u2019s the first addition the Lakers have made during the season. The Clippers added veteran guard Reggie Jackson and Morris\u2019 twin brother, Marcus; the Rockets added veterans Robert Covington, Jeff Green and Demarre Carroll. Morris could still be claimed by another team with cap space \u2013 or trade exceptions \u2013 off waivers before Sunday. \n\nMorris, 30, was averaging 11 points and 3.9 rebounds while shooting 39.7 percent from 3-point range in 44 games for the Pistons, who have torn down their roster for a full rebuild. Over nine seasons, he has averaged 11.6 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 623 games while shooting 34.5 percent from beyond the arc. The Athletic reported that Morris was told the Lakers would use him as a reserve power forward, potentially freeing up Kyle Kuzma to see more minutes at small forward. \n\nThe Lakers were in the running to add Morris last season, when he was bought out by the Washington Wizards, but he instead signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder. \n\nMorris reportedly is leaving $4.3 million, the remainder of this season and his 2020-21 salary, on the table, according to ESPN. The Lakers can use a $1.75 million exception, awarded by the NBA when Cousins suffered his injury, to help sign Morris \u2013 significantly higher than the veteran\u2019s minimum. \nA subplot of the potential move is a rivalry between the twin Morris brothers for the Los Angeles franchises. At Clippers practice on Friday, Marcus Morris said he\u2019d still support his brother even though he would be playing for the Lakers. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be in Staples Center all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI think maybe to y\u2019all it might be weird that I\u2019m going to all his games, but that\u2019s what\u2019ll probably happen. And we\u2019ll probably get a house together.\u201d \n\nAs recently as Thursday, the Lakers addressed questions as to whether Cousins, a popular player in the Lakers locker room, would be ready for the playoffs. \nThe move seems to acknowledge that Cousins\u2019 medical progress didn\u2019t look good to return this year. Vogel said that it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cideal\u201d for the 29-year-old to be finding his rhythm again during the postseason. \n\nThe New York Times reported that Cousins, if he is not picked up by another team, might be permitted to continue rehabbing his injury at the Lakers\u2019 practice facility. \n\nThe Lakers originally signed Cousins in July, hoping the former All-Star\u2019s bond with Anthony Davis would lead to something special. Cousins came in with injury concerns, suffering an Achilles rupture in 2018 when he played with Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans, and tearing his left quadriceps in the middle of Golden State\u2019s 2019 postseason run. \n\nThe move comes as Cousins made his first public comments about his injury and his offseason misdemeanor domestic violence allegation (since dismissed) on a podcast earlier in the week. On \u201cAll The Smoke\u201d with former NBA players Steven Jackson and Matt Barnes, Cousins said: \u201cI said the wrong thing. Heat of the moment, we\u2019ve all done it.\u201d \n\n\n"},"8":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tCharisma Osborne scores 32 to lead UCLA women\u2019s basketball past Washington State\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/charisma-osborne-scores-32-to-lead-ucla-womens-basketball-past-washington-state\/","discription":"\nPULLMAN, Wash. \u2014 UCLA coach Cori Close had one thing to say about her team\u2019s come-from-behind win over Washington State: Thank goodness for Charisma Osborne. \n\n\u201cWe were in a heap of trouble if it weren\u2019t for Charisma,\u201d Close said. \u201cThe bottom line is though, I\u2019m bringing the joy because we found a way.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOsborne had a career-high 32 points and 11 rebounds and No. 8 UCLA rallied in the fourth quarter and beat Washington State 70-62 Friday night. \n\nTrailing 61-57 with 3:30 remaining, Osborne was fouled on a 3-point attempt. She made all three free throws, pulling the Bruins within a point. \nKiana Jefferson made two baskets and Osborne hit a jumper with 1:14 left to close out the Cougars. \n\nThe Bruins (23-3, 12-3 Pac-12) won despite shooting just 34% from the field and committing 17 turnovers. UCLA improved to 23-8 all-time in Pullman and has won consecutive games following an 80-66 home loss to No. 3 Oregon on Feb. 14. \n\nOsborne, who averages 14 points, posted a career high in scoring for the second straight game. She put up 22 points in the Bruins\u2019 83-74 overtime win over No. 15 Oregon State on Monday. \n\nOsborne shot 11 of 21 against Washington State and recorded her third double-double of the season. She was the only Bruins player to score in double figures. \n\nBorislava Hristova scored 29 points for Washington State (11-16, 4-11 Pac-12), which lost its fourth straight. Hristova went down with what appeared to be a leg injury with a little over a minute to play. She returned after being checked out in the locker room. Chanelle Molina added 15 points and nine rebounds for the Cougars. \n\u201cWell, I feel a lot of emotion right now. Just really proud of our team and how hard they played. Their start of the game was unbelievable energy wise and we really had tremendous effort by Bobby and Molina, two kids who you would expect it from as seniors,\u201d said WSU Coach Kamie Ethridge. \u201cThis was just a really good UCLA team that has so many weapons that it is hard to hold them down for an entire game.\u201d \n\nUCLA shot 25% in the first quarter as Washington State jumped out to a 19-11 lead behind Hristova\u2019s 11 points. Washington State center Bella Murekatete had four steals and the Cougars forced nine turnovers on a UCLA team that averages 11.4 per game. \n\nUCLA cut the Washington State lead to 34-31 in the second quarter as Osborne took control, scoring 12 of her team\u2019s 20 points on 5-of-7 shooting. \n\nUCLA took its first lead when Michaela Onyenwere scored a layup off a fast break, making the score 39-38 with 6:49 left in the third. \n\n With South Carolina, Baylor and Oregon having established themselves as the three best teams in the country, UCLA is in a crowded field competing for the final No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. The Bruins have only one marquee non-conference win (at Indiana) and their three remaining games are against teams in the bottom half of the Pac-12 standings. They will need a convincing finish to the regular season to make their case for the final top seed in March. \n\n The Cougars have lost 34 straight games against Top-25 ranked teams. They are currently 7-7 when playing in Pullman and will have one more opportunity, on Sunday against USC, to secure their first winning season at home since 2016-2017. \n\n At Washington on Sunday. \n\n Host USC on Sunday. \n"},"9":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tDodgers photo day at spring training: See the new and returning faces\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/20\/dodgers-photo-day-at-spring-training-see-the-new-and-returning-faces\/","discription":"\n \nNew Dodgers starting pitcher David Price poses for a portrait during Spring Training Photo Day on Thursday at Camelback Ranch in Glendale, Ariz.

Now Dad is officially on the quarterback market. \n\nHe will take his first snaps as an ex-Charger in 2020, and the final identifying characteristic of the franchise will be gone, just as it moves into SoWhat Stadium. \n\u201cThis is not a sad day,\u201d said Nick Hardwick, Rivers\u2019 center when the Chargers last played in an AFC Championship Game, at New England in 2007. \n\nHe meant it wasn\u2019t sad for Rivers. \n\n\u201cIt can be a great experience for him to walk into a new stadium, to deal with a new franchise and have new teammates,\u201d Hardwick said. \u201cThis is an opportunity.\u201d \n\nOffhand, Hardwick thought Indianapolis could be the landing spot, with strong blocking and with Frank Reich, the Chargers\u2019 former offensive coordinator, as the head man. \n\nHe also noted that Tampa Bay\u2019s Bruce Arians has fed and cared for older quarterbacks over the years. \n\u201cBut there\u2019s New England, too,\u201d Hardwick said. \u201cIf Tom Brady really does go elsewhere, it would be fun for Philip to go inside the Death Star and see how they go about things. New England was the base camp for the AFC Championship Game almost every year. \n\n\u201cAnd I thought about the Raiders, too. They\u2019ve got a great center in Rodney Hudson, and a good running game, and I think Jon Gruden knows about Philip. It might take a little getting used to, seeing Philip in that uniform, but people will get used to it.\u201d \n\nSeeing someone else in the lightning-bolt hat might be difficult, too. \n\nAlmost every mock-drafter, with only two-and-a-half months until Roger Goodell takes the stage, thinks Oregon\u2019s Justin Herbert will be the Chargers\u2019 first pick, at No. 6. Tyrod Taylor has started an NFL playoff game and can place-hold the position until Herbert readies himself. \n\nAnd it\u2019s true that Rivers\u2019 misfirings helped send the Chargers spiraling to 5-11, a year after they went 12-4 and won a playoff game in Baltimore. \n\nBut Rivers has teed it up 235 consecutive times, more than any other quarterback except for Brett Favre (321). Russell Wilson, at 128, is the only other QB with an active triple-digit streak. \n\nRivers played that \n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times it didn\u2019t look like he could get ready for the next week, and then he did,\u201d Hardwick said. \u201cHe\u2019s the toughest guy I\u2019ve ever been around. He\u2019s an offensive lineman playing quarterback.\u201d \n\nRivers is a famous chirper who fired shots across the scrimmage DMZ. Hardwick was a sideline reporter one day in San Diego when Denver\u2019s Von Miller sacked Rivers, who grabbed Miller\u2019s jersey, wouldn\u2019t let him up and then followed him into the Denver huddle to land the last word. \n\nOne day the Ravens got to Rivers, but he threw for a first down anyway, and then he looked at Baltimore coach John Harbaugh and yelled, \u201cYou call that a blitz?\u201d \n\n\u201cMy favorite times were the mornings,\u201d Hardwick said. \u201cWe\u2019d go through the tape, and he\u2019d identify every blitz the other team had, who was coming, who was giving it away just by the way they were standing, what we should look if he did come. To this day he can tell you every defensive back he ever played against and what his tendencies were. Then we\u2019d go out there Sunday and it would happen just like he said.\u201d \n\nRivers began learning football when most kids began teething. His dad Steve was his high school coach in Athens, Ala. He was throwing varsity footballs before he was old enough to grip them, and that evolved into his funky delivery that he wasn\u2019t supposed to turn into 397 touchdown passes and 123 wins, and he led the NFL in 10 different categories during his career. \n\nWith all the recent inefficiencies, he still has 7.8 yards per pass attempt, ninth all-time and second (to Wilson) among today\u2019s QBs. \n\nAuburn tried to recruit him as a tight end, and Rivers, who is 6-foot-5 and 228, also played safety and linebacker. One year he intercepted seven passes. \n\n\u201cI can imagine what he\u2019ll be like when he coaches a high school team,\u201d Hardwick said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in-your-face, non-stop, all the things he is as a quarterback.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019ll notice the present tense. After three years of indignity in a sports park, Philip Rivers deserves another home game, or eight. \n\n\u00a0 \n\nPhilip Rivers\u2019 Top 10 throws from his final season with the \n\u2014 NFL (@NFL) \n\n"},"15":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tKings host two of NHL\u2019s best in Nathan MacKinnon, Leon Draisaitl this weekend\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/kings-host-two-of-nhls-best-in-nathan-mackinnon-leon-draisaitl-this-weekend\/","discription":"\nWhile the Kings have been sellers leading up to the NHL trade deadline, hockey fans should be buyers at Staples Center this weekend as the Kings welcome arguably the two best players in the league this season. \n\nThey\u2019ll face the Colorado Avalanche and center Nathan MacKinnon on Saturday and then square off with left wing Leon Draisaitl and the Edmonton Oilers on Sunday.

They won plenty of battles along the boards and in front of the nets. They hardly looked like a defeated team after falling behind by a goal late in the second period. \n\nThe Ducks simply couldn\u2019t score and they couldn\u2019t beat the Colorado Avalanche on Friday at Honda Center, absorbing a 1-0 defeat. Their third consecutive loss was unlike their previous two, far more competitive than the others, but in the end, the result was the same. \n\nAvalanche goalie Pavel Francouz made 26 saves for his first NHL shutout, turning away the league\u2019s second-worst offensive team again and again. J.T. Compher scored the only goal of the game, beating John Gibson on a one-timed shot after a Ducks turnover in the second period. \n\nGibson made 28 saves, but couldn\u2019t stop Compher\u2019s laser from the left faceoff circle, off a pass from teammate Martin Kaut at 16:38 of the middle period. Ducks coach Dallas Eakins declined to fault defenseman Hampus Lindholm for an errant breakout pass that Kaut intercepted at the blue line. \nLindholm had a team-leading five shots in a team-high 22:53 of ice time. \n\n\u201cI see what our defenseman saw,\u201d Eakins said, referring to Lindholm. \u201cTheir guy (Kaut) came out of his blind spot. It was a real honest mistake. That\u2019s the only one I can remember from the night. It\u2019s a bit of an outlier. Overall, I thought our \u2018D\u2019 moved the puck pretty well.\u201d \n\nThe first period was evenly-played, the Avalanche assumed control in the second and then the Ducks pushed back hard in the third. The Ducks couldn\u2019t fire the puck behind Francouz, who started his third consecutive game after Philipp Grubauer suffered a lower-body injury Feb. 15. \n\nDucks defenseman Michael Del Zotto certainly could have used a little better luck on his close-range bid in the first period and then on another chance in the third. One shot struck the crossbar and ricocheted out of harm\u2019s way and the other glanced off the nob of Francouz\u2019s stick. \n\n\u201cOff the crossbar, off the post in the last game, off his nob in the third period tonight,\u201d Del Zotto said. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting some pretty good looks. I\u2019ve been getting more ice time as of late, playing on the power play some. When that happens, you feel more comfortable with the puck. \n\u201cI\u2019m getting good looks. It\u2019s just a matter of one or two going in and getting on a hot streak.\u201d \n\nThe Ducks\u2019 frustration was evident by game\u2019s end. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way it goes, 6-5 or 1-0, it\u2019s the same thing, really,\u201d center Adam Henrique said. \u201cI thought we played hard, battled hard, stuck to the game plan. They were getting pressure. We did a good job defensively. They\u2019re shifty. They\u2019re fast. They create a lot. We were fairly poised. \n\n\u201cThe other side of it is, we\u2019ve got to find a way to get one. That\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d \n\nDefenseman Cam Fowler sat out for the second consecutive game because of an unspecified lower-body injury and there was no timetable for his return to the lineup. Fowler had played in each of the Ducks\u2019 first 59 games before he was sidelined for Wednesday\u2019s game against Florida. \n\nThe Ducks were down to only six healthy defensemen for the second game in a row. Erik Gudbranson continues to be sidelined by an unspecified upper-body injury that kept him out of the lineup for a sixth consecutive game (not including the postponed game against St. Louis on Feb.\u00a011). \n\n\u201cI do not know the timeline,\u201d Eakins said when asked after the game for an update on Fowler\u2019s status. \u201cI do know he\u2019s been examined (by team doctors). He\u2019s out of the question for the weekend. I know that. I don\u2019t know how much longer.\u201d \n\nLindholm played in his 500th game in the NHL, all with the Ducks, who drafted him in the first round (sixth overall) in 2012.

With a big promotional company, you need ability but also marketability. \n\n\u201cSometimes we have a prospect and we need to protect him early in his career. Then the fans rip the fight. It\u2019s a no-win situation.\u201d \n\u201cThe goal is to get them a title,\u201d said Trampler, who \nTrampler and Goodman watch undercard fighters, guys in four-rounders fighting in bars, Golden Gloves hopefuls, Olympians, any pugilist anywhere on earth. They are a 2-man Boxipedia. \n\nBoth worked for Teddy Brenner, the acclaimed matchmaker at Madison Square Garden. He was a tough sell, too. \n\nGoodman remembers raving about a young Roberto Duran. Brenner quietly showed him film of Ike Williams, a former lightweight champion who was 126-24-4. \u201cThe guy was sensational, poetry in motion,\u201d Goodman said. \n\n\u201cTeddy did the same thing with me,\u201d Trampler said. \u201cHe said Carlos Ortiz would kick Duran\u2019s ass.\u201d \n\nAfter a win by Pacquiao, Top Rank chief Bob Arum excitedly asked, \u201cBrucester, isn\u2019t he the best fighter you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d \n\n\u201cBob,\u201d Trampler replied, \u201che isn\u2019t even the best welterweight you\u2019ve ever promoted.\u201d \n\nArum sputtered, but two days later he told Trampler he was right. \n\nTrampler says Ray Leonard was the last truly great fighter. But he and Goodman keep laboring, primarily because it\u2019s love. \n\nTrampler saw his first fight in 1967: Joe Frazier vs. George Chuvalo in the old Garden. He went to Ohio University and interviewed Bill Douglas for the school paper. Bill\u2019s son Buster upset Mike Tyson 23 years later. \n\n\u201cBill had a 5-2 record,\u201d Tramplre said, \u201cand no manager, so I managed him while I was in college. Then Chris and Angelo Dundee hired me out of college and I started doing their press releases.\u201d \n\nGoodman was 15 when he began working for Brenner and publicist Irving Rudd. \u201cI\u2019d sit on the couch and listen to Teddy and Bruce, and I\u2019d keep my mouth shut,\u201d he said. \n\nSoon he\u2019d tag along when fights came to Atlantic City, N.J. Eventually he moved west when Top Rank came to Vegas. \n\n\u201cBruce would absolutely destroy me,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cI was an East Coast guy and those were the fighters I know. I\u2019d say, let\u2019s put so-and-so on. He\u2019d look at me like I was nuts. I had to educate myself on the Mexican fighters.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe still yell at each other,\u201d Trampler said. \u201cHe\u2019ll come up with a fight and I\u2019ll say, \u2018That sucks.\u2019 Then I\u2019ll do the same thing and he says, \u2018What are you, nuts?\u2019\u2019\u2019 \n\nBut they have their favorites, like Earnie Shavers, who had 68 knockouts. Goodman skipped school to watch \n\u201cShavers gave me his shirt, which I still have,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cBut when I came home, there were cops all around, My mom thought I\u2019d been kidnapped. I got punished for that. Three months without watching boxing.\u201d \n\nHe laughed. \u201cThe next Friday, I was watching boxing.\u201d \n\nTrampler nodded. \n\n\u201cYou know, maybe four or five years before, I refereed Shavers against Leroy Caldwell in a little town in Ohio,\u201d he said. \n\nYes. Newton Falls, in the high school gym, 1972. For Trampler and Goodman, there\u2019s a big world in that small ring. \n  \n\t\t\t"},"20":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tUSA Gymnastics asks Nassar survivors to release Steve Penny, USOPC, Karolyis, Don Peters from legal claims\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/usa-gymnastics-asks-nassar-survivors-to-release-steve-penny-usopc-karolyis-don-peters-from-legal-claims\/","discription":"\nSpeaking during a 2018 sentencing hearing for former U.S. Olympic and national team physician Larry Nassar, Rachael Denhollander, a former gymnast and Nassar survivor, asked \u201cHow much is a little girl worth?\u201d \n\nAccording to a USA Gymnastics bankruptcy filing Friday night, it\u2019s as little as $82,000. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIn a disclosure statement filed with U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana, USA Gymnastics said it is asking Nassar survivors to accept a settlement agreement that would pay $1.25 million to former Olympic and World Championships team members who were abused by Nassar but $82,550 to others. \n\nThe settlement agreement releases the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, former USA Gymnastics CEO Steve Penny and former national team directors Bela and Martha Karolyi from all claims but does not address the extent USA Gymnastics officials were aware of the predatory behavior of Nassar and others and to what steps, if any, they took to conceal that sexual abuse from unknowing potential victims. \nThe proposed $217-million settlement is part of a reorganization plan USA Gymnastics filed with the court earlier this year. USA Gymnastics filed for Chapter 11 protection in December 2018. \n\nThe 77-page filing states that if they approve the settlement agreement, the 517 Nassar survivors would agree to release \u201cany and all claims arising from or related to Abuse Claims or Future Claims.\u201d \n\nIn addition to the USOPC, Penny, the Karolyis and five Karolyi-related businesses, the settlement proposal also calls for the release of former U.S. Olympic team and SCATS coach Don Peters, 2012 Olympic coach John Geddert, former USA Gymnastics senior vice president Rhonda Faehn, former USA Gymnastics board chairman Paul Parilla, former USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi, former USA Gymnastics national teams manager Amy White, former USA Gymnastics sports medicine official Debra Van Horn and the All Olympia Gymnastics Center in Southern California. \n\n\u201cUSOPC is a beneficiary of the Settlement Election\u2019s release and its injunctions,\u201d according to the filing. \n\n\u201cThe only way the USOPC will agree to\u201d the settlement \u201cis if it is protected by the release and injunctions described\u201d in the agreement. \nThe proposed settlement, an attorney for USA Gymnastics wrote in the filing, \u201cis in the best interests of, and provides the highest and most expeditious recovery to, all parties who hold claims\u201d against the organization. \n\nThe disclose statement outlines how the survivors would be broken up into four groups. Women who were sexually abused by Nassar at the Olympics, Worlds, national team training camps or other national team events would receive $1,250,757 each. Simone Biles, the four-time Olympic and 19-time World champion, and all five members of the record setting 2012 Olympic gold medal-winning team said they were abused by Nassar while they represented the U.S. at the Olympic Games, World Championships and other major international competitions as well as national team training camps at the Karolyi Ranch in Central Texas. \n\nNon-elite gymnasts sexually abused at USA Gymnastics-sanctioned events would receive $508,670 each. Individuals abused at non-USA Gymnastics locations would receive $174,401 each and individuals with \u201cderivative claims\u201d $82,550 each. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear for parents considering putting your child in a gym sanctioned by USA Gymnastics what USA Gymnastics is saying if we place a known pedophile in that gym and that individual rapes your child then your child is worth $82,000,\u201d said John Manly, an attorney for dozens of Nassar survivors. \u201cMy client Rachael Denhollander asked what is a little girl worth. Apparently if you\u2019re raped by the national team doctor you\u2019re worth $82,000 to USA Gymnastics. \n\n\u201cThis is the most disgusting, reprehensible, vile view of children I can imagine. And for (USA Gymnastics) to put this out there and act like it is a constructive step shows how out of touch they are. Steve Penny was so bad USA Gymnastics banned him for life, the Karolyis, every one of them, and they pay nothing. They have no consequences. What message does that send to the next Steve Penny? The message is you get off scot free. You\u2019re better off putting your kids in roller derby.\u201d \n\n Under the heading \u201cnon-monetary commitments and reforms\u201d USA Gymnastics states in the filing that \u201cin addition to compensating survivors\u2026USAG is committed to taking concrete action to address concerns that survivors and others have raised about the organization and its culture.\u201d But neither the disclosure statement or a reorganization plan filed with the bankruptcy court last month make any mention of USA Gymnastics disclosing documents or information that would reveal the organization\u2019s role and that of others in creating the culture of abuse within the sport that enabled Nassar\u2019s abuse. \n\nUSA Gymnastics in the disclosure statement does assert that the organization has made \u201csignificant progress\u201d in taking steps to prevent future abuse. The filing states that \u201cone of the most significant changes USAG made during the case was its decision to hire Li Li Leung\u201d as the organization\u2019s CEO last year. \n\nLeung receives $450,000 in annual compensation and as much as $90,000 annual in bonuses, according to financial records and court filings. \n\nUSA Gymnastics is facing hundreds of lawsuits across the country that allege the organization and its top officials and coaches fostered a culture of abuse that enabled the predatory behavior of Nassar and other coaches and officials, and then, in consultation with U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and FBI officials, attempted to conceal that sexual abuse from the public. \n\nUSA Gymnastics filed for protection under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy for the Southern District of Indiana in December 2018. \n\nThat Chapter 11 filing prompted an automatic stay on all legal proceedings and litigation, including discovery, against USA Gymnastics, and the USOPC\u2019s efforts to strip the organization of its national governing body status. \n\nThe USOPC has not said if it proceed with the decertification process, should a settlement be reached. \n\nThe proposal comes after months of talks between attorneys for USA Gymnastics and the hundreds of Nassar survivors have stalled with the two sides still hundreds of millions of dollars apart. It also follows a motion filed by attorneys for the survivors in January asking the bankruptcy court to dismiss USA Gymnastics\u2019 bid for Chapter 11 protection. \n\n\u201cUSAG\/USOC, and its revolving door of executives since, have done everything in their collective power to conceal the truth from Nassar\u2019s hundreds of survivors, the more than 100 survivors of abuse suffered at the hands of coaches over the past several decades, law enforcement authorities, and the American public,\u201d James I. Stang, an attorney for a committee representing survivor wrote in the January filing. \u201cThe coordinated strategy of USAG and the USOC was, and remains to be, to delay, deflect and deny them and non-Nassar survivors justice for the horrible crimes committed upon them as children. Sadly, USAG and the USOC have used this bankruptcy proceeding as yet another tool to inflict pain upon these sexual abuse survivors \u2013 both Nassar and non-Nassar survivors \u2013 and to deny justice to these girls and women who competed for this institution and their country.\u201d \n\nUnder the reorganization plan, USA Gymnastics proposes two options of for sexual abuse survivors: accept $215 million to settle all claims or continue to pursue judgments in civil suits from insurance policies available to the organization. \n\nIf the survivors vote to accept the settlement, the insurers for a Michigan gym owned by the family of former U.S. Olympic coach John Geddert would also contribute an additional $2.125 million to the settlement amount. Nassar routinely treated young athletes at the gym, Twistars, located near Lansing. \n\nUSA Gymnastics\u2019 proposed settlement is less than half the $500 million settlement Michigan State reached with survivors of sexual abuse by Nassar, a former member of the Michigan State sports medicine staff. \n\nNassar is serving a\u00a060-year federal prison sentence\u00a0on child pornography charges. He was also sentenced in Ingham County, Michigan, last January to 40 to 175 years for child sexual assault and 40-125 years in Eaton County, Michigan, on similar charges in February. \n\nPenny was first informed of Nassar\u2019s sexual abuse of U.S. national team member Maggie Nichols in June 2015. In the following weeks Penny was also informed that Olympic champions Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney had also likely been sexually assaulted by Nassar. Yet Penny kept the abuse hidden from the public until September 2016, working with FBI agents in the bureau\u2019s Indianapolis office, other USA Gymnastics officials and board members, as well as an attorney for the organization, according to\u00a0documents obtained by the Southern California News Group. \n\nNassar, according to court documents, sexually abused at least 40 young athletes between Penny\u2019s first contact with the FBI agent in charge of the bureau\u2019s Indianapolis office in July 2015 and September 2016, when Nassar\u2019s abuse became public. The number of victims in that window could actually surpass 100, according to persons familiar with dozens of Nassar-related lawsuits. \n\nNassar was allowed to retire as U.S. national team coach in September 2015 without he or USA Gymnastics describing the reason behind his departure. \n\nPenny was arrested in October 2018 after a Texas grand jury indicted him on felony evidence tampering charges. The indictment alleges Penny ordered the removal of documents from the Karolyi Ranch related to Nassar\u2019s activities. \n\n\u201cThe indictment further\u00a0alleges that\u00a0the removal of the documents\u00a0was done for the purpose of impairing the ongoing investigation by destroying or hiding\u00a0the\u00a0documents,\u201d according to the Walker County, Texas District Attorney\u2019s office. \n\nPenny was fired as USA Gymnastics CEO and president in March 2017 under pressure from the USOPC. He has denied any wrongdoing. \n\nFaehn, then USA Gymnastics senior vice president for its women\u2019s program, was informed of concerns about Nassar\u2019s procedures on June 17, 2015 by Sarah Jantzi, Maggie Nichols\u2019 club coach. Jantzi told Faehn that Nichols described \u201cthree uncomfortable encounters of therapy with Nassar\u201d\u00a0 including massaging her groin area \u201ctoo close to the vagina.\u201d \n\nFaehn reported the call to Penny that day. It would be weeks, however, before Penny and other USA Gymnastics officials contacted the FBI about Nassar. Faehn was forced out at USA Gymnastics in May 2018. \n\n\u201cUnbelievably painful\u2026 total disregard for the athletes that were used, abused, and now swept to the side!\u201d John Nichols, Maggie\u2019s father, wrote on twitter Friday night after the Orange County Register first posted details from the disclosure statement. \n\nWhite, the USA Gymnastics national teams manager, on Penny\u2019s orders removed several boxes of medical records and other documents relevant to the Larry Nassar investigation from the Karolyi Ranch in November 2016, according to Faehn in a sworn deposition. \n\nFaehn said in the deposition that White in March confided to her that Penny called her and told her to remove records from the Karolyi Ranch and transport them to USA Gymnastics headquarters in Indianapolis. \n\nWhite told Faehn that after returning to the headquarters \u201cshe gave them to Steve Penny,\u201d Faehn said referring to the medical records. \n\nPeters, the coach of the groundbreaking 1984 U.S. Olympic women\u2019s team, was banned for life by USA Gymnastics in 2011 following a Register investigation that reported he had sex with three teenage gymnasts. \n\n\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0 \n  \n\t\t\t"}}
