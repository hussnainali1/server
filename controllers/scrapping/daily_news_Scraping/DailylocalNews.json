They thought the worst was behind them.\u201d\nBut soon after this picture was taken, Seltzer\u2019s platoon was ordered to move out, the fight was not done. The Japanese, who had been lying in wait in the tunnels and spider holes, attacked them from the rear, killing another four men in this picture.\n\u201cAs Bill was telling me the story, he was reliving the battle again in his mind,\u201d Pietro said. \u201cHe was back in the tunnels and the hours of hand to hand combat that he endured after becoming lost inside them. He talked of the relief he felt of finally getting out.\n\u201cNone of that ever escaped him, just like the men who died in that place and would never escape their fate \u2013 the men he would always call heroes. Bill believed he was the last, living survivor of the men who fought their way to the top of Mount Suribachi, an honor he held, but lamented, as well. I hope you can understand why.\n\u201cHe was that man next to you in the grocery aisle, or driving alongside you down Magnolia or Buena Vista boulevards in his beloved Burbank.

(Photo by Sarah Reingewirtz, Pasadena Star-News\/SCNG)\n\nConsidered the first step in a journey to becoming housed again, a new center that includes showers, bathrooms and storage bins will be available for homeless people in North Hollywood early next month.\nAs the city inches closer to opening more shelters and affordable housing in the San Fernando Valley, the new $5.7 million facility at 11839 Sherman Way, near Lankershim Boulevard, will serve as a \u201cnavigation center,\u201d a starting point to getting sheltered, employed and eventually housed.\nThe facility is being billed by elected officials as the first of its kind in the city. But it took significant convincing over the past few years to get it built.\n\u201cOver the years I\u2019ve had people tell me that this isn\u2019t a solution, that the problem is much bigger than this, and that this is just a band-aid,\u201d said Laurie Craft of Hope of Valley, the operator of the facility.\nBut Craft said that even a band-aid serves a purpose \u2014 to \u201cfacilitate and promote healing\u201d and to prevent people from deteriorating into even worse condition.\nCraft said that while serving homeless people over the years, she has seen \u201ctransformations that are literally unbelievable \u2014 people that had been living on the streets chronically homeless for many many years who are now productive individuals and part of our community.\u201d\n\u201cThis navigation center will be a place where people will be welcomed and treated with the dignity and respect that they deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cLiving on our streets, is sometimes overwhelming and seems like an insurmountable task.\u201d\nIn recent years, the focus has centered primarily on finding or creating housing. But experts say housing is the end of the tunnel \u2014 and the more immediate, day-to-day needs of homeless people, have recently attracted more attention.\nCraft spoke at the center\u2019s Thursday, Feb. 20 grand opening. The event was populated by public officials \u2014 among them Mayor Eric Garcetti \u2014 each contributing their remarks to cheer the occasion, a spark of hope during a week in which Gov. Gavin Newsom declared the state\u2019s enduring homeless crisis \u201ca disgrace.\u201d\nCouncilman Paul Krekorian spearheaded the project and shepherded the Proposition HHH and state dollars toward getting it built. He said the site will also eventually house a \u201cday laborer\u201d center and hinted that some of the patrons of the facility might also be able to take advantage landing work via those services.\nWhen the facility opens its doors on March 9, people who walk in will be able to sign up for the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority\u2019s coordinated entry-system pipeline, and for a waiting list to get matched with housing assistance and other services. Two case managers, and eventually a housing navigator, will work out of one of the trailers.\nThe operators of the facility are expecting that the five showers and five bathrooms, along with a room of 120 trash bins, re-purposed as storage containers, will have significant allure for those now living nearby on the streets.\nOfficials said there will also be limited shuttle service, mainly to transport people from the facility to their various appointments. A bus stop stands right outside the facility, too.\nA few miles away from the center, at an encampment near the Orange Line, 56-year-old Constance Gervasoni was helping a friend collect several articles of clothing, before Los Angeles sanitation crews were scheduled to perform a clean-up in the area.\nThe idea of storage bins nearby sounded promising to her, because she has lost belongings repeatedly, she said. It is like starting over each time, she said.\nShe\u2019s lost phone chargers, clothes and other items, she said, and her husband recently lost artwork he created. Sometimes such items are stolen, she said, and other times they get thrown away or picked up when a cleanup crew comes through.\nStorage options are limited for the homeless and often unavailable at shelters, making it tougher to persuade homeless people to seek help there.\nGervasoni has tried a few storage solutions of her own. She said this is her third time paying the \u201cfirst month\u201d $1 promotional fee at a storage site, but she\u2019ll have to move her possessions out when the charges kick in for the \u201creal month.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be such a relief to have storage, for real,\u201d she said.\nThe availability of showers at the center seems promising, too, Gervasoni said. She is \u201cfilthy,\u201d she said, and has not showered for a month, but is reluctant to wait in line for the shower at Hope of the Valley\u2019s day center in Van Nuys for fear that her belongings will be taken while she is away.\nAs for the opportunity to land a job, she said that was also an attractive possibility. And the day laborer center intrigued her.\n\u201cYou want to put in a little, if you want to get a little,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t, then you\u2019re not part of the human course. You\u2019re not part of mankind.\u201d"},"11":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tWest Valley board member faces two challengers in high-spending LAUSD election\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/14\/west-valley-board-member-faces-two-challengers-in-high-spending-lausd-election\/","discription":"\nFour seats are up for grabs on the seven-member \nThe high stakes are apparent in outside spending dollar amounts from the two usual power players, teachers union United Teachers Los Angeles and the California Charter Schools Association. The latter is hoping to reshuffle a union majority block on the school board.\nOne of such union-friendly seats at play is the one occupied by Scott Schmerelson, who oversees 106 total elementary, middle and high schools in the West San Fernando Valley. His board district three seat, which includes Chatsworth, parts of Woodland Hills, Northridge, Granada Hills, parts of Van Nuys and Sherman Oaks, faces two challengers.\nIf a candidate fails to win more than 50% of the vote in March, the top two finishers advance to a runoff election. Check which board district represents your neighborhood school \nAlongside district Superintendent Austin Beutner, board members oversee daily operations of the massive school district with a $7 billion budget. The position earns a yearly salary of $125,000 plus retirement and health benefits.\n: Schmerelson was first elected to his seat in 2015 after defeating then-incumbent city prosecutor Tamar Galatzan. He began his career as a Spanish language teacher in Philadelphia, first entering LAUSD as a teacher at Virgil Middle School. He worked his way up to principal at Lawrence Middle in Chatsworth and later Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr. Middle in South L.A.\nSchmerelson was an early board members to express support for striking teachers and is staunchly backed by LAUSD\u2019s powerful teachers union, reflected in the over $400,000 of independent expenditures spent on his behalf by United Teachers Los Angeles. He has $24,105 cash raised on hand.\n: An LAUSD parent, Koziatek is community outreach manager for Granada Hills Charter High School and chair of Valley Industry Commerce Association\u2019s education committee. With $20,121 cash on hand, she has received $400,000 of support in independent expenditures from the California Charter Schools Association, the Sacramento-based advocacy organization has spent even more opposing Schmerelson\u2019s candidacy.\n: This election marks the latest of Badger\u2019s several runs for local public office in recent years. The parent of two LAUSD students runs the Minority Outreach Committee, a nonpartisan non-profit that aims to bridge gaps between communities of color and schools.\n: Of all LAUSD grade levels, 43.9% of students met state standards in English and 33.47% in math for the 2018-19 school year. Asked how he plans to lift student achievement, Schmerelson said will advocate for parent representatives at every school in the district to increase parent engagement. Koziatek pointed to her experience at Granada Hills Charter High, where she used technological tools to engage families and chart more student data. Badger said the district has failed children for lack of good leadership, and raised issues of special needs education and school security.\n: According to 2018-19 budget reports, LAUSD received $15,537 per-pupil which, depending on which way you slice the data, puts California in the lower middle or bottom tier of public school funding nationwide. As a delegate to the California School Board Association, Schmerelson said he intends to advocate for higher per-pupil state funding in Sacramento that will enable the additional hiring of school nurses, librarians and counselors. Koziatek echoed the need for more funding, and referred to her school budgetary experience. Badger suggested the district needs to look inward at streamlining the budget before asking taxpayers to open their pockets.\n: LAUSD is home to 320 charter schools this 2019-20 school year, a number that served as a flashpoint during last year\u2019s teachers strike. Recently passed Assembly Bill 1505 gave California school boards more authority to inhibit the opening of new ones. Schmerelson has expressed a need to give traditional public schools \u201cthe same authority\u201d as charter schools before approving new charters in the district. Koziatek said she would make decisions on charter schools based on how a school has shown it can serve students. Badger described herself as being \u201cokay\u201d with charters as long as they\u2019re adhering to the same rules and regulations as traditional public schools."},"12":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tLAPD to embed 10 officers at Pacoima\u2019s San Fernando Gardens through latest community-policing project\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/20\/lapd-to-embed-10-officers-at-pacoimas-san-fernando-gardens-through-latest-community-policing-project\/","discription":"\nThe San Fernando Valley\u2019s only public housing project soon will be home to a new kind of beat cop, and city officials hope the program will show the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s radical experiment with community policing is still working.\nSan Fernando Gardens \u2014 a 1,500-resident, World War II-era development of low-slung, cream-colored apartment blocks located in the heart of Pacoima \u2014 \nCouncilwoman Monica Rodriguez, LAPD Chief Michel Moore and other officials will launch the program with a community event at the project. They expect hundreds of residents from around the area to turn out for food and games.\nIn a statement, Rodriguez\u2019s office said the 10 CSP officers and a supervisor will be \u201ctasked with developing positive police-community relationships through sports and educational programs, addressing crime trends in collaboration with community members, and exercising law enforcement duties through a long-term problem-solving approach.\u201d\nThe San Fernando Gardens CSP is the city\u2019s ninth. The first partnerships were set up in L.A.\u2019s most violent housing projects, mostly in South L.A.\nThe idea was to embed a team of officers in the projects to talk to residents and solve quality of life issues. That could mean anything from starting youth sports programs to fixing lighting on darkened streets to chasing away violent, stray dogs.\nThe program is a huge departure from LAPD\u2019s traditional response to crime in low-income, majority black and Latino communities.\nTwenty-five years ago, LAPD employed a boots-on-the-ground strategy, swarming areas around housing projects, or other crime-plagued communities, at certain times in an effort to prevent shootings and killings.\nViolent arrests might follow, as well as frequent stops of innocent people. Those tactics alienated residents.\n\u201cIf we saw someone committing a crime, you put handcuffs on them and you take them to jail,\u201d said Captain David Grimes, who commands LAPD\u2019s Foothill Division covering Pacoima.\n\u201cWhat we figured out over the years was that arresting people and putting them in jail doesn\u2019t make crime go away.\u201d\nOfficers assigned to the CSP will still make arrests if they witness someone committing a violent crime. But Grimes gave the example of a teenage tagger seen spray-painting graffiti on a house or a wall \u2014 the goal now is to divert that child to more resources, not put them behind bars.\nNumerous L.A. officials, including Mayor Eric Garcetti and Chief Moore, have become believers in the program. The first four CSPs were credited with helping reduce gang homicides in projects like Nickerson Gardens and Jordan Downs to nearly zero in most years after they were set up.\n\u201cI am sold on this,\u201d Grimes said of the program. \u201cI believe it. I\u2019ve been to enough meetings. I\u2019m convinced it works.\u201d\nWhile San Fernando Gardens has been mostly free of intense gang violence since the early 2000s, crime is still common. Poverty and drugs in the project itself, and the neighborhoods nearby, are still issues.\nOn most days, however, the Gardens themselves are mostly quiet. Still, Grimes said he has seen worrying trends in the crime rate for the area. Part 1 crimes, which include most violent crimes, overall are up nearly double in the projects from 2014 to 2018.\nThere were no killings in the Gardens last year, and just one the year before. But other crimes \u2014 aggravated assault, domestic violence, burglaries, robberies, etc. \u2014 are on the rise."}}
