Through her counsel Usama Khawar Ghumman, the applicant pleaded that the Peca, the parent law, conferred limited powers to \u201cremove or block or issue directions for removal or blocking of access to information through any information system.She said the parent law did not give the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) the power to sub-delegate any of its powers, including the delegation of rules to National Coordinator \u2013 a person appointed by the federal government.The applicant further contended that the federal government had very limited rule-making powers under the sections of the Peca and the PTA Act.\u201cNeither these sections confer powers upon the federal government to frame rules that can empower its delegated functionaries to frame rules having the effect of law, nor the power to delegate is to be read as a part of the power to frame rules,\u201d she said, adding the constitutional courts of the country also did not allow such excessive delegation and already declared such practices to be an exercise in excessive delegation liable to be struck down.She pleaded that the sub-statutory rules could not impose or create new restrictions beyond the scope of the parent law. However, she said, the impugned \u201cOnline Harm Rules\u201d introduced a new extremely broad and vague definition of \u201cextremism\u201d with penal consequences infringing upon the fundamental rights of citizens.Ms Ali pointed out that the remedy for review and appeal provided under the impugned regulations was very limited and narrow. She said a high court, under the regulations, while hearing an appeal would be limited to adjudication upon grounds of the review, and not the entirety of the record.This limitation, she believed, had the effect of not providing a right of appeal to citizens whose fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, right to access to information, right to dignity and privacy, would have been infringed upon. She said this limitation would also be a blatant violation of the citizens\u2019 rights to fair trial and access to justice.Through the application, the activist also sought the court\u2019s permission to become a party to a pending petition in favour of the impugned regulations and urged the court to dismiss the same.Published in Dawn, February 23rd, 2020"},"1":{"tilte":"Govt remains befuddled over how to deal with online harm\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1535943\/govt-remains-befuddled-over-how-to-deal-with-online-harm","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/02\/5e50a0a558f2b.jpg","discription":"It has been four years since the draconian Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) was passed, but confusion still reigns in the country over how to deal with harmful content on social media. On Feb 15, the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) \u2014 a group of internet companies, including giants such as Facebook, Twitter and Google \u2014 wrote a letter to Prime Minister Imran Khan, warning him that new rules to regulate social media activity would make it \u201cextremely difficult\u201d for digital companies to operate in Pakistan. Amid criticism, Prime Minister Khan said \u201call stakeholders\u201d would be taken on board before implementing the new rules. Without delving into details of the process, he hoped that all internet companies would continue to work in Pakistan and that the government would address their grievances. Uncertainty persists because some officials maintain the new rules were \u201capproved\u201d by the federal cabinet on Jan 28, but not notified. Sources said the rules were not being implemented right now and the upcoming consultation would be focused on overall content management and ways to generate revenue. According to PM\u2019s Focal Person on Digital Media Arslan Khalid, a working document on the consultation will be drafted by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and will be made available to the public soon. The PTA says modalities regarding the process will be shared once finalised. Mr Khalid said the stakeholders, including technology firms, civil society activists, parliamentarians, lawyers and media persons, would be consulted on regulating content relating to blasphemy, child pornography, extremism, hate speech, character assassination and fake news. Under the new rules, the internet firms are required to establish permanent offices in the federal capital. About the government\u2019s move, Science and Technology Minister Fawad Chaudhry said that \u201cit is an economic decision which will increase advertising revenue\u201d. However, in a recent interview with Dawn, head of the PM\u2019s Digital Pakistan initiative Tania Aidrus said the country was not ready to invite global platforms. \u201cGlobal firms, including Facebook and Google, have a defined mechanism that decides requirements to enter a country. They are incredibly cautious as they should be,\u201d she had said, adding that the aim was to offer \u201ccomfort, legal framework, security and policy before expecting these companies to work in Pakistan\u201d. A glance at the digital landscape reflects the same. Just over a third of Pakistan\u2019s population or around 76 million people are online in 2020 (17pc growth from 2019). Of the total internet users, only 37m are active social media users. According to the 2020 digital report by We Are Social and Hootsuite, out of the total users the number of people who can be reached with advertising on Facebook is 33m, 6.4m for Instagram and 1.83m for Twitter. If the government is serious about attracting investment, it should demonstrate commitment towards improving the investment climate, which includes financial inclusion, supporting physical and regulatory infrastructure, lowering cost of starting a business, trading across borders, fast tracking of business transactions and resolving commercial disputes. Although Pakistan has improved its global ease of doing business ranking to 108 for 2020, it is still behind other emerging markets. Pakistan\u2019s investment level for instance is almost half the volume attracted by growing economies like Vietnam, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. There are 17pc Pakistanis who have accounts with financial institutions (but only 1pc of the citizens have credit cards) as opposed to 80pc financial inclusion in India and 41pc in Bangladesh. Pakistan spent $856m on digital advertising in 2019 as compared to India\u2019s $6.62bn, according to the digital report. Besides, there is already an ongoing global movement to tax tech giants that supply services over internet to their citizens. A framework, released by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), would allow countries to tax large multinationals even if they did not operate inside their borders. Under the negotiations, involving over 135 countries, including Pakistan, companies will pay taxes \u2014 largely based on where their sales occur. The OECD hopes to reach a consensus-based solution with all member countries by the end of this year. Objectionable contentUnder various provisions of Peca, the \u201cpriority\u201d categories highlighted by the government (with the exception of fake news) are deemed unlawful. In fact, the PTA has reported content to social media companies under those provisions that are related to blasphemy, sectarianism, hate speech, anti-state activity, defamation and impersonation. The government\u2019s concern is that platforms are mostly entertaining the requests in accordance with their own community guidelines \u2014 although those guidelines overlap with most specified categories such as child pornography and extremism. Take Facebook\u2019s example. According to the PTA, the authority has reported a total of 14,296 URLs to Facebook, out of which the platform has removed 12,226 (6,535 for violation of its own community standards).The problem, according to PTA, lies with regulating defamatory and blasphemous content that is reported in high volumes by both the public and over 30 stakeholders that can report content for removal\/blocking. \u201cThrough the e-portal, the Ministry of Religious Affairs alone has so far reported 24,725 links containing blasphemous, pornographic and sectarian material,\u201d the PTA told Dawn. Another popular concern is protecting women, children and minorities online. For authorities investigating and pursuing these cases offline, the reality is different. According to digital rights advocacy group Bolo Bhi\u2019s data, as of Aug 2019, 54 cases under Peca were pending in Karachi. These cases include charges under Section 21 (offences against modesty of a natural person and minority) and Section 20 (offences against dignity of a natural person). In terms of breakdown, seven accused in the cases are in jail custody, 34 are on bail, eight accused have been acquitted while there has been only one conviction. In two cases, the accused have absconded. The new rules are meant to streamline online regulation not amplify it. Unless the government is headed on the same path as its predecessor that approved Peca, the consultation is a chance to set things right.Published in Dawn, February 22nd, 2020"},"2":{"tilte":"Journalists, lawyers, rights bodies to resist move against social media\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1535722\/journalists-lawyers-rights-bodies-to-resist-move-against-social-media","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/02\/5e4f52e9df492.jpg","discription":"ISLAMABAD: As the clamour against the government\u2019s move to regulate social media becomes louder, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), lawyers and civil society members have decided to launch a nationwide movement for getting the Citizens Protection (Against Online Harm) Rules revoked.Journalist unions, lawyers, and civil society organisations termed the recently notified rules unacceptable and urged the government to revoke these immediately and hold consultations over the regulation.The demands were put forward at a press conference at National Press Club here on Thursday.Representatives from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association and Media Matters for Democracy atte\u00adnded the press conference.Nasir Zaidi, PFUJ\u2019s secretary general, read out a joint statement contending that the rules exceeded the mandate given by the 2016 Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act.\u201cThe rules [to regulate social media] were approved by the cabinet without any debate,\u201d Mr Zaidi said. \u201cThe clampdown on online content is the final extreme in a long series of restrictions on freedom of expression and press freedom in Pakistan.\u201dHe outlined a \u201cplan of action\u201d thrashed out by the PFUJ, in concert with the three \u201cpartner organisations\u201d, to launch a countrywide drive against enforcement of the rules.\u201cPress conferences will be held at press clubs in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta,\u201d Mr Zaidi said.

The RSF said that in reality it was designed to extend the government\u2019s media censorship to online video content, but was rejected as unconstitutional by the Senate Human Rights Committee, which said that Pemra did not have the authority to do this.On Feb 15, the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) \u2014 a group of several internet companies, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon, Airbnb, Apple, Booking.com, Expedia Group, Grab, LinkedIn, LINE, Rakuten, and Yahoo (Oath) \u2014 wrote a letter to the prime minister on Feb 15, warning him that new rules to regulate social media activity would make it \u201cextremely difficult\u201d for digital companies to operate in Pakistan.Under the new rules, social media companies will be obliged to disclose any information or data to a designated investigation agency, when sought.

Its potential to become an even bigger part of people\u2019s daily existence is sky-high.The rising popularity of the cloud has gone hand-in-hand with that of 4G broadband technology and of smartphones: The combined power of the network and of servers makes it possible for us to listen to music, to watch videos, to work remotely, to post on social media or to request a ride and watch it arrive, in real time, on a smartphone map.Companies and individuals can buy not just cloud-based storage but also processing power, Internet services and software, all of it situated not in one\u2019s computer or smartphone but in huge data centres.There are now even cloud services for video games, which require enormous amounts of data and extremely rapid response times.\u201cCloud gaming,\u201d as with other uses, lets users dispense with expensive and fast-outdated equipment.Most big companies and institutions now access the cloud either through their own private servers or as a client of a public cloud provided by a company such as Amazon, Microsoft or Google.These big providers offer an array of options, from simple hosting to ultra-complete online services, with an a la carte menu of tools and software, and with programmes ensuring maintenance and security.The public cloud can thus provide savings while also allowing greater flexibility as users\u2019 needs evolve.In practice, many companies choose a hybrid approach, melding the lower cost, greater power and high adaptability of the public cloud with the comforting security of a private cloud.\u201cCompanies on average use about three different public-cloud providers,\u201d said Bob O\u2019Donnell, president and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.While some companies grew up in the data world, he added, \u201clet\u2019s not forget that lots of companies have been moving slowly and cautiously; plenty of companies are just getting started.\u201d In 2020, the market for the public cloud is expected to reach $266 billion, a 17 percent increase over 2019, according to Gartner Consulting.And market research firm IDC (International Data Corporation) predicts a near-doubling of the market by 2023, to $500 billion.The 2006 launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) gave the online giant a huge lead over its competitors. Analysts put its current share of the global public-cloud market at 30 to 50 percent.AWS had 2019 revenues of $35 billion and claims millions of users worldwide.It did suffer one setback last year: In October, the Pentagon awarded a mega-contract worth $10 billion to Microsoft, the second largest player in the market.Against a backdrop of hostility between US President Donald Trump and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, the company is taking legal action in an attempt to block the Microsoft contract.A federal court on Thursday ordered the Pentagon to temporarily halt its work with Microsoft while the matter is reviewed.Microsoft, meanwhile, has not released precise figures on the success of Azure, its public cloud, making comparisons difficult. But the company\u2019s cloud division has turned in Microsoft\u2019s best performances, quarter after quarter. Azure controls approximately 15 percent of the market.Trailing it are Google Cloud and China\u2019s Alibaba, each with a five or six percent share.For Google, the American leader in internet research, the cloud is a growing priority: It showcases the company\u2019s capacity for very large-scale data analysis as well as the ability for users of the hybrid cloud or of multiple clouds to easily shift data from one provider to ano\u00adther.

Before the introduction of DIRBS, handsets with valid and invalid IMEIs were brought into Pakistan through legal and grey channels.\u201dHe said that several problems emerged after the implementation of the system including high taxation, negative impact on used handset retail industry and affordability of handsets on the back of discouraging business environment and lack of awareness among the people. But apart from the dent to the cellular industry and handset trade, it was a new phenomenon, which was identified recently that the system had not even helped curbing street crimes as originally envisaged by the authorities.The question emerged about the reason behind the rise in street crimes despite the system was in place to curb such illegal activities.Investigators cite some surprising facts, which they have found during the course of their job, claiming that it\u2019s no more a secret that the handsets being snatching and stolen in the city, are being trafficked to neighbouring countries through illegal channels.\u201cI am not sure about Iran but definitely we have found in our investigations of multiple cases that these handsets [snatched and stolen in Karachi] are trafficked to Afghanistan,\u201d said Raja Umar Khattab of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD). \u201cIt\u2019s an organised crime so the people involved in the trade have made proper arrangements. What we need to do is to check where and who is breaching this system.\u201dHe said that the handsets which were not useable due to DIRBS after they were snatched or stolen in Karachi were packed to be sent to Afghanistan but he was not convinced that the new system was fully effective even within the country.\u201cIt needs to be checked and checked again. I think if the number of cellphone snatching is still increasing and such business is still effective despite the system is in place, we need to do a technical audit of the entire exercise and the system and fix issues where required,\u201d he added.Published in Dawn, February 17th, 2020"},"8":{"tilte":"Sarmayacar bets on mobile gaming by investing in Revolving Games\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1534007\/sarmayacar-bets-on-mobile-gaming-by-investing-in-revolving-games","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/02\/5e438b6416e6e.jpg","discription":"Revolving Games, a brainchild of brothers Ammar Zaeem and Shayan Zaeem who have a decade of mobile game development experience under their belt, is set to launch its first game next year, said Sarmayacar \u2014 a venture capital firm for tech startups \u2014 in a press statement.

In the car, the minimum cost is Rs100 while the charges for making the driver wait are Rs2 per minute. The variable fare stands at Rs9.38 per kilometer and the minimum charges are Rs150 which have to be paid even if the ride is cancelled.Careem offers users four options: Go, Economy, Wifi Cars and Business.For 'Go,' Careem charges at least Rs150 while the basic fare is Rs100. The variable fare stands at Rs11 per kilometre. For 'economy,' the minimum charges are Rs175, whereas for 'business' and 'wifi cars' the the minimum charge is Rs250.\nUber and Careem both allow their users to pay by either credit card or cash. Additionally Careem also allows users to preload credit to their accounts and automatically deducts the cost of each ride.In both Uber and Careem, just like in a taxi, it is a stranger driving the car. Therefore, the issue of safety is of prime concern. Both companies are taking precautions in this regard, when it comes to signing drivers, to ensure safety of their customers.It is a fact that Uber's service has faced criticism in many parts of the world due to incidents of sexual assault involving drivers and customers. This appears to be one explanation for why women in Pakistan prefer Careem\u2019s service.After talking with some male Uber users, it seems that while they use the service themselves they advise family members, especially female, to opt for Careem, citing the incidents of assault from around the world.Although it\u2019s not possible to comprehensively rate one company over another just because of what some people say, most women we spoke to for this story said they would choose Careem over Uber because of \u201cwell-behaved drivers\u201d, \u201cbetter service\u201d, and \u201ca sense of security.\u201d On the other hand, most male users had similar impressions of both services. Some of the male users we spoke to did agree that Careem stands out because of their \u201cwell-trained and courteous drivers.\u201d To them, despite the fact that Uber is a relatively low cost alternative to Careem, its drivers lack the level of professionalism one expects and there is a perception that they are hired without sufficient background checks. This does not mean that Careem is free of any shortcomings. Browsing through its Facebook page, you find complaints about drivers\u2019 bad behavior; some people also claimed that they were charged for making the captain wait even though it was the captain who had arrived late. On Uber\u2019s Facebook page, one is more likely to see positive comments and feedback. Some of the user complaints on the page are related to cars arriving late and customers still being charged for the wait. Some people have also complained about Uber Auto rickshaw drivers\u2019 attitudes and lack of proper training when it comes to using the App provided to them.\nUber\u2019s Facebook presence is robust and almost every individual comment on their page is responded to with instructions for lodging a complaint. On the other hand, Careem\u2019s Facebook page is not as active if one draws a comparison.  Although these services are relatively new in Pakistan, they are sure to reduce public transport woes by a significant margin and mark the end of traditional taxi and rent-a-car business\u2019 dominance in the long run. As smartphone penetration increases, taxi and rickshaw drivers that struggle to adopt new technologies may find themselves in trouble. This is due to the fact that both companies have become immensely popular in such a short time and are widely used by young, employed people who are most likely to be smartphone users. It appears that these companies are focusing more and more on this demographic, in the hope of positive experiences and reviews that translate to rapid growth in the near future. However, it is likely that these companies face resistance and backlash from local transport unions whose businesses could be adversely affected.
