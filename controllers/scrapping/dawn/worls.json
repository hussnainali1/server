He said 95 people had been infected across Iran.\nJahanpur put the death toll at 15, but the state news agency later said one person infected by the virus had died in the city of Saveh. Some unconfirmed reports gave a higher death toll.\nThe outbreak in Iran has coincided with mounting US pressure on Iran's clerical rulers that has hit the economy hard. In 2018, the United States exited Tehran's nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed sanctions.\nWorried that official numbers could underestimate the scale of Iran's outbreak, many Iranians took to social media to accuse authorities of concealing facts.\nPopular anger has been high for months over the handling of a Ukrainian passenger plane crash in January, which the military took three days to admit was caused by an Iranian missile fired in error.\nThe incident revived anti-government protests that rocked the country in November against a hike in fuel prices, which swiftly turned political with calls for Iran's rulers to step down, before authorities cracked down.\nThe head of the Medical Science University in the holy city of Qom, Mohammad Reza Ghadir, expressed concern over \u201cthe spread of those people infected by the virus across the city\u201d, adding the health ministry had banned releasing figures linked to the coronavirus.\nAuthorities on Tuesday ordered the nationwide cancellation of concerts and soccer matches and the closure of schools and universities in many provinces, and urging Iranians to stay home.\nIran said on Monday 900 cases were suspected, dismissing claims by a lawmaker from Qom who said 50 people had died in the city, the epicentre of the new coronavirus outbreak.\n\u201cIt is an uninvited and inauspicious visitor. God willing we will get through [...] this virus,\u201d said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in a televised speech.\nIran, which confirmed its first two deaths last week in Qom, has yet to say how many people it has quarantined, but the semi-official Mehr news agency said 320 people had been hospitalised.\nThe virus outbreak threatens to isolate Iran further, with several countries suspending flights after coronavirus cases in travellers from Iran were confirmed in Canada, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan and Iraq.\nSome neighbouring countries closed their borders. United Arab Emirates state media said Dubai airport had suspended all flights to and from Iran.\nOman's Khasab port is suspending the import and export of goods to and from Iran from Wednesday, operator Marafi said on Twitter.\nUS State Secretary Mike Pompeo on Tuesday said the United States was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d Iran may have covered up details about the spread of coronavirus, and he called on all nations to \u201ctell the truth.\u201d\n\u201cThe US is deeply concerned by information indicating the Iranian regime may have suppressed vital details about the outbreak in that country,\u201d Pompeo told reporters, as he also criticised Beijing for what he characterised as the censorship of media and medical professionals.\n\u201cAll nations, including Iran, should tell the truth about the coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organisations,\u201d he said.

I want to leave that to India and hopefully they're going to make the right decision for the people,\" Trump said.\nAccording to the Scroll.in, angry mobs threw stones and petrol bombs at Muslim homes in Kabir Nagar, near Maujpur. Journalists were also attacked and many were forced to delete pictures and videos from their phones, the publication added.\nThe report added that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said he had a \"positive meeting\" with Home Minister Amit Shah regarding the riots in the Indian capital. Speaking to the media, he maintained that police were outnumbered and were unable to take action as they did not have orders to do so, the publication said.\nA photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT\n \nAccording to The Wire, stone-pelting and arson have continued in the Ghonda area, close to Maujpur.\nAcross the locality, The Wire saw broken and burnt vehicles, burnt shops and vehicles still on fire. There were some police standing at the edge of the Hindu-majority area, but did not intervene when vehicles were burning, the publication said. \nIn the Bhajanpur area in the city's northeast, black smoke rose into the sky after Hindu protesters set fruit and vegetable shops and a Muslim shrine on fire, witnesses said.\nMeanwhile, a mosque in Ashok Nagar neighbourhood was set on fire late on Tuesday afternoon, The Wire reported. It said a mob shouting \u201cJai Shri Ram\u201d and \u201cHinduon ka Hindustan\u201d paraded around the mosque, and a Hanuman flag was placed on the mosque's minaret. Shops near the mosque were looted by the mob.\nCommenting on the development, President Arif Alvi in a tweet termed the vandalising of the mosque a \"disgraceful act\". \"It seems to be a reminder to Muslims of the Babri Masjid episode. I think secular forces within India should rise against such barbaric actions,\" he wrote.\n \nThe clashes erupted in a northeastern district of the city between thousands of people demonstrating for and against the new citizenship law. \nEyewitnesses said the violence continued overnight, and several shops were broken. \u201cThere was stone pelting in the area early this morning also,\u201d a resident was quoted as saying.\n \nTensions in parts of the city remained high on Tuesday with schools remaining shut in some areas amid news reports of fresh clashes. At least five metro stations in the city were closed.\nDeputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia tweeted that schools in the capital's northeast would be shut on Tuesday and exams postponed.\n \nAn official at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in New Delhi said 13 people had died there and more than 150 injured had been treated at the hospital, many from bullet wounds.\nAn official at the Al-Hind Hospital in New Delhi said two men had died and over 200 injured had been treated there.\nA fire department official said his teams were responding to more than a dozen calls over arson attacks, despite emergency measures prohibiting any gatherings in the violence-hit areas.\n\u201cWe have sought police protection as our vehicles are being blocked from entering the affected areas. The situation is very grim,\u201d Delhi Fire Department Director Atul Garg said.\nOne fire department vehicle was torched by protesters on Monday and a small number of firemen were injured, Garg added.\nThe joint commissioner of police, Alok Kumar, said around 3,500 police and paramilitary officers had been deployed.\nPolice fired teargas and pellets to scatter demonstrators protesting against the citizenship law in the Jafrabad neighbourhood of northeast Delhi on Tuesday. A young man suffered a pellet wound to his thigh, while another sustained injuries to his eyes, leaving his face bloodied.\nThe violence on Monday began just as Trump arrived on his maiden visit to India. \n \nAt a press conference early on Tuesday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed for people to maintain peace.\n \n\"Whatever problems people have can be resolved peacefully,\" he said. \"Violence will not help find a solution.\"\nIndia's capital has been a hotbed of protests against the new Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which eases the path of non-Muslims from three neighbouring Muslim-dominated countries to gain Indian citizenship.\nThis has led to accusations that Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are undermining India's secular traditions. \nThe BJP denies any bias against India's more than 180 million-strong Muslim minority, but objectors have been holding protests and camping out in parts of New Delhi for two months.\nReuters reporters saw multiple vehicles set on fire, metal barricades torn down and thick smoke billowing as supporters of the new law clashed with opponents. A small contingent of police was vastly outnumbered.\nThe clashes stretched over a nearly kilometre-long road and lasted from early afternoon until well into the evening, leaving at least half a dozen people injured.\n \nPolice on Monday imposed an emergency law prohibiting any gatherings in the violence-hit areas.\nThe protesters appeared to be divided along religious lines, and some repeatedly hailed Hindu god Ram while pelting stones at the predominantly Muslim group opposed to the new law.\nA Reuters witness saw at least one Muslim man and a burqa-clad woman were beaten by dozens of pro-law protesters with sticks and iron rods.\nEarlier on Monday, local politician Yogendra Yadav described the violence as \"communal\" and urged police to intervene.\nBut for several hours, Reuters witnesses saw the outnumbered policemen mostly stand beside those backing the citizenship law, a majority Hindu group, and do little to quell the violence. \nThe police also stood by as a mob vandalised a store with a Muslim name, pulling out vehicles and setting them alight.\n\"Go ahead and throw stones,\" one policeman shouted to protesters backing the law, during one of the running battles.\n \nOn side streets, young boys drained fuel from motorcycles to make petrol bombs, and protesters pulled up paving stones and flung construction material at opponents.\n\"We are in support of the CAA. If they want to protest, they should go somewhere else,\" said a protester who gave his name as Amit.\nIndia's junior home minister G Kishan Reddy said the violence was a \"conspiracy to shame India globally\" during Trump's visit.\n\"We have deployed additional forces, and we will do everything to bring law and order under control,\" he told Reuters partner ANI.\nNational BJP spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal echoed similar thoughts. \u201cThe timing of these riots creates suspicion about them being politically motivated. For over 60 days, people were protesting in Shaheen Bagh without any significant outcome. Our government believes that dissent has a place in democracy and they have the right to protest within the established process.\n\u201cBut indulging in such violence is not the way. Surely, when the head of a nation is in India and such violence is taking place, there is definitely a group, a politicial design behind it. This is being done to tarnish the image of India,\u201d he said, according to The Print. \nAhead of Trump's arrival in India, a senior US administration official had said Trump would raise the issue of religious freedom in India during his meetings with Modi.\nAddressing a gathering of more than 100,000 people in Gujarat, however, Trump made no mention of the protests enveloping India over its Citizenship Amendment Act. \nAt the rally in Ahmedabad, Trump praised India\u2019s history of religious tolerance, and \u201cmany faiths worshipping side-by-side\u201d.\n\"India is a country that proudly embraces freedom, liberty, individual rights, the rule of law, and the dignity of every human being,\" he said.\nIn Pakistan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan said that the violent clashes on India's citizenship law, in President Trump's presence, have shown the world the truth.\n \n\"Has the world [now] seen who suffers from mental illnesses like prejudice, extremism and warmongering?\" Awan said in a tweet."},"4":{"tilte":"After raucous welcome in India, Trump clinches $3bn military equipment sale\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1536592\/after-raucous-welcome-in-india-trump-clinches-3bn-military-equipment-sale","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/02\/5e54e5c13f7a9.jpg","discription":"\nUS President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that India will buy $3 billion worth of military equipment, including attack helicopters, as the two countries deepen defence and commercial ties in an attempt to balance the weight of China in the region.\n\"India and the United States were also making progress on a big trade deal,\" Trump said in New Delhi.\nNegotiators from the two sides have wrangled for months to narrow differences on farm goods, medical devices, digital trade and new tariffs.\nTrump was accorded a massive reception in Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state on Monday, with more than 100,000 people filling into a cricket stadium for a \u201cNamaste Trump\u201d rally.\nOn Tuesday, Trump sat down for one-on-one talks with Modi followed by delegation-level meetings to try and move forward on issues that have divided them, mainly the festering trade dispute.\nAfter those meetings, Trump said his visit had been productive with the conclusion of deals to buy helicopters for the Indian military.

Titanic, Inc., called witnesses before a federal judge on Thursday to explain why the company should be allowed to possibly cut into the rapidly deteriorating ship to recover the device before it\u2019s irretrievable.\nIt\u2019s one of those iconic artefacts, like the signal flares (that the sinking ship launched), testified David Gallo, an oceanographer who retired from Woods Hole Oceanographic Insti\u00adtution and is now a paid consultant for the firm.\nGallo, who testified in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia, said that salvaging the device would not be grave robbery but a way to connect people to the ship\u2019s legacy and honor its passengers.\nUS District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith, the maritime jurist who presides over Titanic salvage matters, said it was too early for her to make any decisions on the proposal. She said she needed more details and proposed scheduling another hearing sometime in the future.\nThe Titanic was traveling from England to New York when it struck an iceberg at 11:40 pm on April 14, 1912. The large and luxurious ocean liner sent out distress signals using the relatively new Marconi wireless radio system.\nThe messages in Morse code were picked up by other ships and onshore receiving stations. They included: We require immediate assistance ...  \u201cHave struck iceberg and sinking\u201d ...  \u201cWe are putting women off in boats.\u201d The ship sank in less than three hours, with the loss of all but 700 of the 2,208 passengers and crew.\nAn international team led by oceanographer Robert Ballard located the wreckage in 1985 on the North Atlantic seabed, about 400 miles (645 kilometers) off Newfoundland, Canada.\nRMS Titanic Inc., oversees a collection of thousands of items recovered from the site over the years as the court-recognized salvor, or steward of the artefacts.\nThe company has argued that time is running out to retrieve the telegraph machine.\nIt has been referred to as the voice of the Titanic, which also delivered the ship\u2019s last words.\nThe device is located in a room on the ship\u2019s deck. A gymnasium on the other side of the grand staircase has already collapsed. The roof above the telegraph machine has begun to perforate.\nI\u2019m not sure if we go in 2020 that the roof won\u2019t be collapsed on everything, testified Paul Henry Nargeolet, director of the company\u2019s underwater research program.\nThe company is already facing resistance from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin\u00adistration, which represents the public\u2019s interest in the wreck site.\nThe US Attorney\u2019s Office in Virginia represents NOAA. Its attorneys argued in court documents that the proposed retrieval runs contrary to prior court orders that prohibit the firm from cutting holes or taking items from the wreck.\nThe items that the firm has salvaged came from a debris field outside the ship.\nIt seems clear that this is not simply a one-off proposal for the Marconi Wireless Telegraph, but a placeholder for future requests to take similar actions in order to recover other artifacts from inside the wreck, federal attorney Kent P. Porter wrote.\nPorter also wrote that the court must consider international agreements involving the wreck as well as archaelogical standards to determine whether the retrieval is justified. \nHe cited the United Kingdom-based Joint Nautical Archaeology Policy Committee, which said the company has failed to adequately justify its proposal.\nPublished in Dawn, February 22nd, 2020"},"14":{"tilte":"BTS says new album is all about conquering doubts and fears\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1536599\/bts-says-new-album-is-all-about-conquering-doubts-and-fears","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/02\/5e5501f08deab.jpg","discription":"\nThe young stars in South Korean boy band BTS said on Monday the theme of their new album dealt with how they overcame doubts and fears encountered since they burst on the K-Pop scene seven years ago.\nHaving performed at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles last month, BTS stands at the forefront of South Korean pop music and has helped gather an international audience for the genre.\nOn Friday, the band released Map of the Soul: 7, its fourth album.

India is buying 24 SeaHawk helicopters from Lockheed Martin equipped with Hellfire missiles worth $2.6 billion and also plans a follow-on order for six Apache helicopters.\nIndia is modernising its military to narrow the gap with China and has increasingly turned to the United States over traditional supplier, Russia.\nTrump said the two countries were also making progress on a trade deal, which had been an area of growing friction between them.\n\u201cOur teams have made tremendous progress on a comprehensive trade agreement and I'm optimistic we can reach a deal that will be of great importance to both countries,\u201d said Trump in remarks made alongside Modi.\nThe two countries had initially planned to produce a \u201cmini deal\u201d, but that proved elusive.\nInstead both sides are now aiming for a bigger package, including possibly a free trade agreement.\nTrump said he also discussed with Modi, whom he called his \u201cdear friend\u201d, the importance of a secure 5G telecoms network in India, ahead of a planned airwaves auction by the country.\nThe United States has banned Huawei, arguing the use of its kit creates the potential for espionage by China \u2014 a claim denied by Huawei and Beijing \u2014 but India, where telecoms companies have long used network gear from the Chinese firm, is yet to make a call.\nTrump described Monday's rally in Ahmedabad and again praised Modi and spoke of the size of the crowd, claiming there were \u201cthousands of people outside trying to get in [...] I would even imagine they were there more for you than for me, I would hope so,\u201d he told Modi.\n\u201cThe people love you [...] every time I mentioned your name, they would cheer.\u201d\nIn New Delhi, Trump was given a formal state welcome on Tuesday at the red sandstone presidential palace with a 21-cannon gun salute and a red coated honour guard on horseback on a smoggy day.\nIndia is one of the few big countries in the world where Trump's personal approval rating is above 50 per cent and Trump's trip has got wall-to-wall coverage with commentators saying he had hit all the right notes on his first official visit to the world's biggest democracy.\nThey were also effusive in their praise for Modi for pulling off a spectacular reception for Trump.\n\u201cModi-Trump hug gets tighter,\u201d ran a headline in the Times of India.\nBut in a sign of the underlying political tensions in India, violent protests broke out in Delhi on Monday over a new citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims and is a further attempt to undermine the secular foundations of India's democracy. They say the law is part of a pattern of divisiveness being followed by Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.\nAt least 7 people were killed and about 150 injured in the clashes that took place in another part of the capital, away from the centre of the city where Modi is hosting Trump.\nIn his speech on Monday, Trump extolled India's rise as a stable and prosperous democracy as one of the achievements of the century. \u201cYou have done it as a tolerant country. And you have done it as a great, free country,\u201d he said.\nDelhi has also been struggling with high air pollution and on Tuesday the air quality was moderately poor at 193 on a government index that measures pollution up to a scale of 500. The WHO considers anything above 60 as unhealthy."}}
