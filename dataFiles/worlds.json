It is expected (to continue),\u201d he added, referring to the US commander in charge of foreign forces in Afghanistan.\nA Taliban source did not immediately comment.\nThe partial truce saw scenes of jubilant Afghans dancing in the street as hopes rose that Afghanistan's 18-year-old war might finally come to an end.\nBut, in a sign of a bumpy road ahead, Ghani pushed back against a clause in the deal that calls for the Taliban to release up to 1,000 prisoners and for the Afghan government to release up to 5,000 insurgent captives.\n\u201cThere is no commitment to releasing 5,000 prisoners,\u201d Ghani said.\n\u201cThis is the right and the self-will of the people of Afghanistan. It could be included in the agenda of the intra-Afghan talks, but cannot be a prerequisite for talks.\u201d He added that any prisoner release was \u201cnot in the authority of the US, it is in the authority of the Afghan government.\u201d \nThe president, who is mired in a political crisis following fraud allegations in his re-election, was referring to upcoming talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government that were agreed to as part of the deal.\nThe Taliban had until now refused to negotiate with Ghani's administration, which they considered a US puppet regime, but the withdrawal agreement hinges on Kabul and the insurgents reaching a separate peace deal through \u201cintra-Afghan\u201d negotiations.\nGhani's questioning of the prisoner release points to tough negotiations ahead in a country where leaders seem incapable of coalescing around important issues.\nWashington has pointedly not yet acknowledged Ghani's win, announced last week after months of delays while his top rival Abdullah Abdullah has vowed to set up a parallel administration.\nThe Taliban's political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar has met with senior diplomats from countries including Russia, Indonesia and Norway, hours after signing a deal with Washington aimed at ending the Afghan war, Taliban said in a statement on Sunday.\nTaliban political chief met foreign ministers from Turkey, Uzbekistan and Norway in Doha along with diplomats from Russia, Indonesia and neighbouring nations, the Taliban said, a move that signalled the group's determination to secure international legitimacy.\n\u201cThe dignitaries who met Mullah Baradar expressed their commitments towards Afghanistan's reconstruction and development [...] the US-Taliban agreement is historical,\u201d said Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid.\n\u201cBaradar received congratulatory messages and thanked them (ministers and diplomats) for attending the ceremony,\u201d he said.\nThe Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 after seizing power following years of civil war, and imposed many restrictions on women and activities it deemed \"un-Islamic\". After being ousted from power in 2001, the Taliban have led a violent insurgency against the internationally-backed government, killing thousands.\nThe Afghan war has been a stalemate for over 18 years, with the Taliban increasingly controlling or contesting more territory, yet unable to capture and hold major urban centres.\nDuring the last two years of direct negotiations with the United States, the Taliban leaders opened direct channels of dialogue with Pakistan, Iran, Russia, China, Germany and Islamic nations, a move that poses a direct threat to the legitimacy of Ghani's government.\n\u201cThe fanfare around the signing ceremony proved that many countries are willing to start fresh talks with Taliban leadership [...] they are also working fast to secure the validation too,\u201d said a senior US diplomat who was present at the signing ceremony in Doha."},"1":{"tilte":"New Malaysia PM sworn in amid crisis, Mahathir fights on\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1537612\/new-malaysia-pm-sworn-in-amid-crisis-mahathir-fights-on","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/03\/5e5b5ac26f1fe.jpg","discription":"\nA former interior minister was sworn in as Malaysia's premier on Sunday, marking the return of a scandal-mired party to power after a reformist government's collapse but ex-leader Mahathir Mohamad, 94, slammed the move as illegal.\nThe Southeast Asian nation was plunged into turmoil after Mahathir's reformist \"Pact of Hope\" alliance, which stormed to a historic victory in 2018, collapsed amid bitter infighting.\nMahathir \u2014 who was the world's oldest leader \u2014 initially quit as premier but then sought to return.

On Sunday, over 12,000 people flooded the grounds of Vic Mathias Shores, along the river, in Austin to hear him speak. \nSupporters started gathering over an hour before seating was supposed to begin, and stood in line patiently, talking to each other about politics, T-shirts and badges, and how they had attended Sanders\u2019 last rally in Austin, in 2016. The weather was great and Austin Bands for Bernie put on a great show featuring Molly Burch\u2019s \u201clove songs for Bernie\u201d, the Black Angels and Jordan Moser, among others, urging action against the Permian Highway Pipeline in Texas, exploitative drug companies, oil companies and climate change. As band after another came on stage to perform and talk about how President Bernie would take away power from thieves, oligarchs and plutocrats and give it back to the people, the audience responded with cheers and waving their Bernie signs, indicating an acceptance and urgency to address problems now being recognized as systemic. \n\u201cThe powers that be are scared of Bernie, he\u2019s too progressive, he\u2019s too scary, we need a moderate,\u201d author and activist Jim Hightower said at the podium. \u201cHe\u2019s running a campaign that\u2019s hotter than high school love.\u201d \nHouston\u2019s Marianne Williamson, who dropped out of the presidential race in January, endorsed Bernie at the rally saying: \u201cIt is said that Bernie can\u2019t beat Trump, they also said you can\u2019t abolish slavery, or give women voting rights.\u201d The former candidate, who enjoyed massive support among American celebrities and progressives, added: \u201cHe [Bernie] has been consistent. He has been convicted, he has been committed. And now it\u2019s time. I\u2019m here and you\u2019re here, because it\u2019s time for us to take a stand with Bernie.\u201d\nAustin residents love a good meditation, and that\u2019s exactly what Bernie\u2019s campaign manager Greg Casar asked the audience to do: close their eyes and meditate on a possible future. \u201cImagine a world where our kids are safe at school. Where the president isn\u2019t calling us rapists and murderers. Imagine a world where the person next to you is not a target. Where every person can live in dignity and freedom\u2026Now open your eyes. This world is within our reach. Can we do this?\u201d\nThe response was a deafening \u201cyes\u201d. \n\u201cAre you ready to fight white supremacy? Are you ready to fight for Medicare for All? Green New Deal? Fight racists and white supremacists?\u201d Yes to all. The audience by now was pumped from imagining the future and then it was time for Bernie to speak. \n\u201cThe limitations of our imagination are in the form of the crises we face today. The wealthiest nation in the world can\u2019t have half a million people sleeping on the streets,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIf the drug companies and Wall Street see this crowd, they will really feel nervous\u2026 this is their nightmare: when they see all over the country, millions demanding decent wages, quality education and healthcare as a human right not a privilege.\u201d \nWhile Texas being the hub of America\u2019s oil and fracking industry has faced its share of climate-change-related disasters, Bernie announced his plan to create 20 million jobs through a transition from dirty energy to renewable energy. \u201cClimate change is an existential threat, Houston is already familiar with that...We have a moral responsibility.\u201d He said his plan on tackling climate change involved reaching out all over the globe including China, India and Pakistan, where instead of spending trillions of dollars on building and deploying weapons of mass destruction, the US could work with those countries to fight the effects of climate change. \nHe vowed to repeal Trump\u2019s \u2018racist\u2019 immigration executive orders and stop demonising immigrants, and end ICE raids that have terrorised communities across the US. \n\u201cWe have an odd sense of justice in this country\u2026 If you are a Wall Street executive, the government will bail you out [even] if you are a crook, but if you are a kid who gets arrested for marijuana you get arrested. We are going to change that criminal justice system,\u201d he announced. Interestingly, without skipping a beat, several people in the crowd lit up joints (though weed isn\u2019t legal in Texas). \nHe then promised to cancel all student debt in the country by taxing Wall Street and making them pay for it. This sounds like a dream or an exercise in meditation but instead of asking whether it can be done, people preferred to listen. \n\u201cNo one from the press asks for Bernie signs,\u201d a campaigner said to me, when I asked for one. \u201cWhy, not?\u201d I asked. \n\u201cMaybe because they hate us?\u201d\nIt\u2019s true. The journalists in the press gallery were laughing at the bands asking the crowd to take action against the Permian Pipeline and other issues important to Texans. The political workers argue that it\u2019s because media organisations are owned by corporations and their interests are tied to maintaining the status quo, and for journalists who interpret \u2018credible source\u2019 as someone in power, this isn\u2019t surprising. This is also why they got the 2016 election results wrong, they say. \nShan Ali Khan, a lawyer from Dallas, who travelled to Iowa ahead of the caucuses there, talks about what Bernie means when he says they are building a \u201cgrassroots movement\u201d. Bernie\u2019s campaign volunteers are connected across states through social media. The focus is on being mobile, visiting door to door, calling up or texting as many people as possible, and making sure the methods and message is consistent across states. It involves reaching out to communities that are otherwise ignored when it comes to campaigning, and that\u2019s being done by thousands of young people from a variety of backgrounds who understand this election as a fight for their own future. \nAs American voters prepare to head to the polls on Super Tuesday, March 3, when the most US states hold elections and over a third of all delegates are allotted to candidates, Senator Bernie Sanders appears to be dominating the polls. While this has left the establishment democrats scared to the point that the NY Times is reporting the party is willing to sabotage itself rather than allowing him to run, Bernie himself is quite clear: \u201cWe are running a campaign for the working class of America, by working class of America, from the working class of America.\u201d\nPublished in Dawn, March 1st, 2020"},"11":{"tilte":"Prince Harry, Jon Bon Jovi recreate Abbey Road Beatles cover\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1537355\/prince-harry-jon-bon-jovi-recreate-abbey-road-beatles-cover","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/02\/5e59cb5e7c1f1.jpg?r=799914342","discription":"\nLONDON: Britain\u2019s Prince Harry and singer Jon Bon Jovi recreated one of the Beatles\u2019 best-known album covers on Friday, walking across the zebra crossing outside Abbey Road recording studios in north London.\nHarry was at the studio to meet the singer and members of a military veterans\u2019 choir in one of his last engagements as a senior member of the royal family.\nAs countless Beatles fans have done since the 1969 release of the \u201cAbbey Road\u201d album, the pair walked across the black and white pedestrian crossing, this time led by a military veteran in a wheelchair.\nEarlier, a video of the two wearing headphones, with Bon Jovi strumming a guitar before beginning to sing was posted on the official Instagram page of Harry and his American wife Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\nThe couple announced in January that they would step down from their duties as senior royals, spend more time in North America and aim to become financially independent.\nThe Invictus Games Choir, who are recording a single for charity, is made up of veterans and serving personnel from the British military.\nTheir song, called \u201cUnbroken,\u201d was created by Bon Jovi to shine a spotlight on veterans living with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\nBon Jovi, whose parents were both in the US Marine Corps, told reporters he had a lot of respect for the royals.\n\u201cI just want to give them a hug,\u201d he said.\nProceeds from the sale of the record will go to the foundation that supports the Invictus Games, a sporting event for sick and injured veterans that is one of Harry\u2019s favourite causes.\nPublished in Dawn, February 29th, 2020"},"12":{"tilte":"Scotland becomes first country to make sanitary products free for all\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1537163\/scotland-becomes-first-country-to-make-sanitary-products-free-for-all","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/02\/5e58d12edc08c.jpg","discription":"\nThe Scottish parliament approved plans on Tuesday to make sanitary products freely available to all women, the first nation in the world to do so.\nThe legislation would make tampons and sanitary pads available at designated public places such as community centres, youth clubs and pharmacies, at an estimated annual cost of 24.1 million pounds ($31.2 million).\nThe Period Products (Free Provision) Scotland Bill passed through its first stage with 112 votes in favour, none against and one abstention.
