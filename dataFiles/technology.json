The GNI is a multi-stakeholder organisation composed of leading information and communication technology (ICT) companies (like Google, Microsoft, Telenor), academics, digital rights and media freedom groups that work to protect freedom of expression and privacy rights in the ICT sector. In its statement on Wednesday, the GNI welcomed the government\u2019s decision to hold \u201cextensive and broad-based consultations\u201d on the rules. \u201cGNI and its members stand ready to engage thoughtfully and respectfully with the government of Pakistan and any other government that is considering how best to address content regulation,\u201d said GNI executive director Judith Lichtenberg. The rules would require social media platforms to comply with censorship orders made without judicial review and facilitate access to the ICT user data endangering privacy. The broad and unspecified nature of these authorities and requirements pose real risks to the digital rights of Pakistani citizens, the GNI said. Welcomes govt decision to hold broad-based consultation\u201cThe Rules Against Online Harm, as currently drafted, raise more questions than they answer. We encourage the government to work with interested stakeholders to ensure proper identification of problems and corresponding solutions,\u201d said Mark Stephens, GNI board independent chair. The rules, the GNI said, raised significant concerns both locally and globally, among internet companies, civil society, and the general public, due to complete absence of consultation with stakeholders and the sweeping scope of the regulations. \u201cWe welcome the decision by the government to hold an \u2018extensive and broad based consultation\u2019 process with all relevant segments of civil society and technology companies about [the rules],\u201d it stated. The GNI expressed confidence that an open, considered approach to any concerns regarding illegal content online would yield more legally-sound results, which empower and protect Pakistani citizens and complement the government\u2019s vision of a \u2018Digital Pakistan\u2019. It pointed out that the rules appeared to have been passed quic\u00adkly and without consultation with stakeholders, calling into question their legitimacy and legality under international human rights law. By establishing broad and unchecked powers to censor a wide range of \u2014 and in some instances vaguely defined \u2014 categories of content, it said, the rules were also difficult to reconcile with the principles of necessity and proportionality. Call to revoke rulesThe GNI called on the government to pull back the rules and engage in a broad, transparent consultation with legislators, civil society, social media companies and other relevant stakeholders. The GNI said the rules challenged the ability of companies to provide encryption for their products and services, raising cybersecurity concerns. In addition, the rules seemed to grant powers that might be greater than the authorising legislation they purport to implement.  It would enhance the government\u2019s authority to demand user data in a non-judicially-supervised manner, raising privacy concerns as well, it added. PTA to lead consultationEarlier this week, the government in a press release had said the Pakistan Telecommunication Autho\u00adrity (PTA) would lead the consultation with relevant stakeholders.  \u201cIn concert with other stakeholders, the PTA will be undertaking extensive, broad-based consultation process with all relevant segments of civil society and technology companies about Citizens Protection (Against Online Harm) Rules,\u201d it said.  The statement neither clarified whether the existing rules would be revoked nor did it specify a time period for the revision plan. The memo document of the rules, labelled \u2018to be published in the official gazette\u2019, has already been uploaded on the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication (MoITT) website.Published in Dawn, February 28th, 2020"},"2":{"tilte":"Internet giants fight spread of coronavirus untruths\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1536767\/internet-giants-fight-spread-of-coronavirus-untruths","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/02\/5e5609a59c763.jpg","discription":"As the new coronavirus spreads globally, the online battle to keep misinformation about the disease is also stepping up.Google, Facebook and other platforms are struggling to keep ahead of scammers, trolls, and others with ill intent who routinely use major tragedies or disasters as opportunities to swindle or manipulate people.\"The public concern about coronavirus is being used as a vehicle to get people to transmit misinformation and disinformation,\" said University of Washington biology professor Carl Bergstrom.Internet companies took part in a meeting with the World Health Organization last week at Facebook offices in Silicon Valley to discuss tactics such as promoting reliable information and fact-checking dubious claims about the coronavirus referred to as COVID-19.\"(We must) combat the spread of rumors and misinformation,\" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told AFP recently.\"To that end, we have worked with Google to make sure people searching for information about coronavirus see WHO information at the top of their search results.\"Google search ranks authoritative sources higher when people are seeking information on health and labels results or news stories that have been fact-checked.Ghebreyesus said that social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Tencent and TikTok have also taken steps to limit spread of misinformation about coronavirus.Facebook said in a recent online post that it is focusing on claims which, if relied on, could increase the likelihood of someone getting sick or not getting proper treatment.\"This includes claims related to false cures or prevention methods \u2014 like drinking bleach cures the coronavirus - or claims that create confusion about health resources that are available,\" Facebook head of health Kang-Xing Jin said in the post.\"We will also block or restrict hashtags used to spread misinformation on Instagram, and are conducting proactive sweeps to find and remove as much of this content as we can.\"Bergstrom said some virus misinformation is \"people trying to sell snake oil products\" such as bogus cures or treatments, while others use attention-grabbing deceptions to drive online traffic that yields money from advertising.Misinformation is also spread by \"actors\" out to fuel distrust for the establishment in China or foment societal instability overall, according to Bergstrom.\"There's appetite for up-to-date, real-time information,\" said Jevin West, co-author of a book on misinformation with Bergstrom.\"These actors can take advantage of that;

A judge later increased that amount to $439.7m including interest and other costs.The case dates back to 2010 when Nevada-based VirnetX filed suit in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas accusing Cupertino, California-based Apple of infringing four patents for secure networks, known as virtual private networks, and secure communications links. VirnetX said Apple infringed with its FaceTime and VPN on Demand features in products such as the iPhone and iPad.The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which specialises in patent disputes, upheld the judgment against Apple last year.During the litigation, Apple and other companies requested that a tribunal of the US Patent and Trademark Office review the validity of the VirnetX patents. The tribunal canceled key parts of the patents at issue in the case.But in separate decisions also issued last year, the Federal Circuit set aside certain of the tribunal\u2019s rulings, bringing VirnetX closer to collecting damages from Apple. Apple appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the damages should be recalculated because the specific patents VirnetX accused it of infringing with FaceTime were nearly wiped out.Apple in a court filing called the Federal Circuit\u2019s refusal to entertain its demands \u201clegally wrong and grossly unfair.\u201d The company also said the lower courts impermissibly allowed VirnetX to request damages far beyond the value of the patented invention.VirnetX told the justices: \u201cThe entire damages award ... remains supported by claims that a jury \u2014 and the Federal Circuit - found valid years ago and that have not been canceled since.\u201dPublished in Dawn, February 25th, 2020"},"4":{"tilte":"LHC takes up social media rules case tomorrow\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1536138\/lhc-takes-up-social-media-rules-case-tomorrow","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/02\/5e5202af5d5f1.jpg","discription":"LAHORE: Lahore High Court Chief Justice Mamoon Rashid Sheikh will hear on Monday an application assailing the legitimacy of new social media regulations published by Ministry of Information, Technology and Telecommunication (MoITT).\u201cThe regulations prima facie appear to be illegal and ultra vires for contravening and exceeding the scope of Pakistan Telecommunication Reorganization Act, 1996 and the Prevention of Electronic Crime Act, 2016 (Peca) and [in] violation of fundamental constitutional rights,\u201d argued the application moved by digital rights activist Ms Jannat Ali. Through her counsel Usama Khawar Ghumman, the applicant pleaded that the Peca, the parent law, conferred limited powers to \u201cremove or block or issue directions for removal or blocking of access to information through any information system.She said the parent law did not give the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) the power to sub-delegate any of its powers, including the delegation of rules to National Coordinator \u2013 a person appointed by the federal government.The applicant further contended that the federal government had very limited rule-making powers under the sections of the Peca and the PTA Act.\u201cNeither these sections confer powers upon the federal government to frame rules that can empower its delegated functionaries to frame rules having the effect of law, nor the power to delegate is to be read as a part of the power to frame rules,\u201d she said, adding the constitutional courts of the country also did not allow such excessive delegation and already declared such practices to be an exercise in excessive delegation liable to be struck down.She pleaded that the sub-statutory rules could not impose or create new restrictions beyond the scope of the parent law. However, she said, the impugned \u201cOnline Harm Rules\u201d introduced a new extremely broad and vague definition of \u201cextremism\u201d with penal consequences infringing upon the fundamental rights of citizens.Ms Ali pointed out that the remedy for review and appeal provided under the impugned regulations was very limited and narrow. She said a high court, under the regulations, while hearing an appeal would be limited to adjudication upon grounds of the review, and not the entirety of the record.This limitation, she believed, had the effect of not providing a right of appeal to citizens whose fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, right to access to information, right to dignity and privacy, would have been infringed upon. She said this limitation would also be a blatant violation of the citizens\u2019 rights to fair trial and access to justice.Through the application, the activist also sought the court\u2019s permission to become a party to a pending petition in favour of the impugned regulations and urged the court to dismiss the same.Published in Dawn, February 23rd, 2020"},"5":{"tilte":"Govt remains befuddled over how to deal with online harm\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1535943\/govt-remains-befuddled-over-how-to-deal-with-online-harm","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/02\/5e50a0a558f2b.jpg","discription":"It has been four years since the draconian Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) was passed, but confusion still reigns in the country over how to deal with harmful content on social media. On Feb 15, the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) \u2014 a group of internet companies, including giants such as Facebook, Twitter and Google \u2014 wrote a letter to Prime Minister Imran Khan, warning him that new rules to regulate social media activity would make it \u201cextremely difficult\u201d for digital companies to operate in Pakistan. Amid criticism, Prime Minister Khan said \u201call stakeholders\u201d would be taken on board before implementing the new rules. Without delving into details of the process, he hoped that all internet companies would continue to work in Pakistan and that the government would address their grievances. Uncertainty persists because some officials maintain the new rules were \u201capproved\u201d by the federal cabinet on Jan 28, but not notified. Sources said the rules were not being implemented right now and the upcoming consultation would be focused on overall content management and ways to generate revenue. According to PM\u2019s Focal Person on Digital Media Arslan Khalid, a working document on the consultation will be drafted by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and will be made available to the public soon. The PTA says modalities regarding the process will be shared once finalised. Mr Khalid said the stakeholders, including technology firms, civil society activists, parliamentarians, lawyers and media persons, would be consulted on regulating content relating to blasphemy, child pornography, extremism, hate speech, character assassination and fake news. Under the new rules, the internet firms are required to establish permanent offices in the federal capital. About the government\u2019s move, Science and Technology Minister Fawad Chaudhry said that \u201cit is an economic decision which will increase advertising revenue\u201d. However, in a recent interview with Dawn, head of the PM\u2019s Digital Pakistan initiative Tania Aidrus said the country was not ready to invite global platforms. \u201cGlobal firms, including Facebook and Google, have a defined mechanism that decides requirements to enter a country. They are incredibly cautious as they should be,\u201d she had said, adding that the aim was to offer \u201ccomfort, legal framework, security and policy before expecting these companies to work in Pakistan\u201d. A glance at the digital landscape reflects the same. Just over a third of Pakistan\u2019s population or around 76 million people are online in 2020 (17pc growth from 2019). Of the total internet users, only 37m are active social media users. According to the 2020 digital report by We Are Social and Hootsuite, out of the total users the number of people who can be reached with advertising on Facebook is 33m, 6.4m for Instagram and 1.83m for Twitter. If the government is serious about attracting investment, it should demonstrate commitment towards improving the investment climate, which includes financial inclusion, supporting physical and regulatory infrastructure, lowering cost of starting a business, trading across borders, fast tracking of business transactions and resolving commercial disputes. Although Pakistan has improved its global ease of doing business ranking to 108 for 2020, it is still behind other emerging markets. Pakistan\u2019s investment level for instance is almost half the volume attracted by growing economies like Vietnam, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. There are 17pc Pakistanis who have accounts with financial institutions (but only 1pc of the citizens have credit cards) as opposed to 80pc financial inclusion in India and 41pc in Bangladesh. Pakistan spent $856m on digital advertising in 2019 as compared to India\u2019s $6.62bn, according to the digital report. Besides, there is already an ongoing global movement to tax tech giants that supply services over internet to their citizens. A framework, released by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), would allow countries to tax large multinationals even if they did not operate inside their borders. Under the negotiations, involving over 135 countries, including Pakistan, companies will pay taxes \u2014 largely based on where their sales occur. The OECD hopes to reach a consensus-based solution with all member countries by the end of this year. Objectionable contentUnder various provisions of Peca, the \u201cpriority\u201d categories highlighted by the government (with the exception of fake news) are deemed unlawful. In fact, the PTA has reported content to social media companies under those provisions that are related to blasphemy, sectarianism, hate speech, anti-state activity, defamation and impersonation. The government\u2019s concern is that platforms are mostly entertaining the requests in accordance with their own community guidelines \u2014 although those guidelines overlap with most specified categories such as child pornography and extremism. Take Facebook\u2019s example. According to the PTA, the authority has reported a total of 14,296 URLs to Facebook, out of which the platform has removed 12,226 (6,535 for violation of its own community standards).The problem, according to PTA, lies with regulating defamatory and blasphemous content that is reported in high volumes by both the public and over 30 stakeholders that can report content for removal\/blocking. \u201cThrough the e-portal, the Ministry of Religious Affairs alone has so far reported 24,725 links containing blasphemous, pornographic and sectarian material,\u201d the PTA told Dawn. Another popular concern is protecting women, children and minorities online. For authorities investigating and pursuing these cases offline, the reality is different. According to digital rights advocacy group Bolo Bhi\u2019s data, as of Aug 2019, 54 cases under Peca were pending in Karachi. These cases include charges under Section 21 (offences against modesty of a natural person and minority) and Section 20 (offences against dignity of a natural person). In terms of breakdown, seven accused in the cases are in jail custody, 34 are on bail, eight accused have been acquitted while there has been only one conviction. In two cases, the accused have absconded. The new rules are meant to streamline online regulation not amplify it. Unless the government is headed on the same path as its predecessor that approved Peca, the consultation is a chance to set things right.Published in Dawn, February 22nd, 2020"},"6":{"tilte":"Journalists, lawyers, rights bodies to resist move against social media\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1535722\/journalists-lawyers-rights-bodies-to-resist-move-against-social-media","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/02\/5e4f52e9df492.jpg","discription":"ISLAMABAD: As the clamour against the government\u2019s move to regulate social media becomes louder, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), lawyers and civil society members have decided to launch a nationwide movement for getting the Citizens Protection (Against Online Harm) Rules revoked.Journalist unions, lawyers, and civil society organisations termed the recently notified rules unacceptable and urged the government to revoke these immediately and hold consultations over the regulation.The demands were put forward at a press conference at National Press Club here on Thursday.Representatives from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association and Media Matters for Democracy atte\u00adnded the press conference.Nasir Zaidi, PFUJ\u2019s secretary general, read out a joint statement contending that the rules exceeded the mandate given by the 2016 Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act.\u201cThe rules [to regulate social media] were approved by the cabinet without any debate,\u201d Mr Zaidi said. \u201cThe clampdown on online content is the final extreme in a long series of restrictions on freedom of expression and press freedom in Pakistan.\u201dHe outlined a \u201cplan of action\u201d thrashed out by the PFUJ, in concert with the three \u201cpartner organisations\u201d, to launch a countrywide drive against enforcement of the rules.\u201cPress conferences will be held at press clubs in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta,\u201d Mr Zaidi said.

The federal government has approved a new policy under which social media companies will be obliged to disclose any information or data to a designated investigation agency, when sought. Failure to do so would entail a fine of up to Rs500 million.Furthermore, social media platforms will be required to remove any \u2018unlawful content\u2019 pointed out to them in writing or electronically signed email within 24 hours, and in emergency cases within six hours. The companies will also have to establish registered offices with a physical address located in Islamabad within the next three months and appoint a focal person.Awan, while speaking to the media today, insisted that previously, the government \"did not know who was creating fake pages and harming socio-cultural and religious values\". The new rules, Awan said, would not only expose Pakistan's opponents but would also enable authorities to stop extremists who spread hate on the basis of religion and race. She claimed that social media was spreading disorder in society by propagating pornography, sexual abuse, child abuse, hate speech and sectarian material. \"[About] 73 per cent of Pakistanis are internet users. Social media users are increasing, especially among the youth. We will not take any step that is against the interests of these users,\" she assured. She said that because these companies have no offices or focal persons in Pakistan, whenever the government asked them to remove harmful material, the decision depended on the companies' disposition.

Earlier, Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry had also denied perceptions that the new rules made to regulate social media content in the country are for political control. Speaking to the media outside Parliament House, Chaudhry explained that the new rules were made to regulate advertisements and harmful content on social media. \"The keyword here is harmful content,\" he said, adding that \"social media is used for maligning women, blasphemy and defaming people and anyone on social media knows there are groups that for Rs20,000 or 30,000 will run trends against you and defame you.\" He pointed out that digital media \"had taken the space of formal media\" and there has been an exponential increase in digital advertising. If it isn't regulated, it will further harm the already-suffering journalists and people, and cause damage to formal media, he cautioned.He said the aim is to hold social media companies answerable within the country's economic framework.

One family used the Wing app to order Tylenol, cough drops, Vitamin C tablets, bottled water and tissues, the statement said. An older resident ordered a birthday present for his wife.Although the majority of the delivery was done by a FedEx truck, the last mile was completed by drone.The yellow and white drones are loaded with packages at a local centre of operations called the \u201cNest,\u201d where Wing employees pack them with up to three pounds (1.3 kilogrammes) of goods, deliverable within a six mile (10 kilometre) radius.Once they have arrived at their destination, the drones don't land. Instead, they hover above the house and lower the package with a cable.Other companies are working to launch similar services, most notably Amazon, UPS and Uber Eats. But Wing was the first to obtain a license from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), authorising company pilots to fly multiple drones at the same time."}}
