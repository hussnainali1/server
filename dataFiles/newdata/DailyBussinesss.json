It announced plans to hire 100,000 workers to meet demand and is temporarily boosting pay among its warehouse employees and instructed its contract delivery partners to also raise wages for drivers who don\u2019t work directly for Amazon. Key rival Walmart Inc. is also hiring workers and doling out bonuses to staff helping it meet demand.\nBoth companies face criticism from lawmakers, workers and activists for not doing enough to protect hourly workers on the front lines of the crisis. The pressure ramped up Friday when a group of workers from Walmart, Amazon and other big retailers, called United for Respect, demanded paid leave for those affected by the coronavirus outbreak and better protective measures from their employers.\nAmazon on Saturday announced hourly workers in its U.S. delivery network would receive double pay for every hour they work in excess of 40 each week, effective March 15 through May 9. That follows temporary raises of $2 per hour that will be in effect through April.\nMonica Moody, a 22-year-old Amazon warehouse worker near Charlotte, North Carolina, said she and her fellow employees don\u2019t have adequate protective gear or sufficient time to wash their hands during their shifts. She argued that the warehouse should close temporarily to be sanitized.\nAlso on Friday, four Democratic senators, led by Cory Booker of New Jersey, wrote to Bezos asking the company to implement more aggressive safety measures and offer more hazard pay to its employees. The letter cited news reports in the past week in which workers at the front lines of Amazon\u2019s logistics network raised concerns they didn\u2019t have the time or resources to protect themselves as they helped speed packages to customer doorsteps. The Amazon delivery drivers in California told Bloomberg they received one single disinfecting wipe to clean vans before the start of their shifts.\nBezos said the company has increased cleaning in its facilities and implemented instructions for employees to maintain a safe distance from one another, and continues to meet daily to address safety issues. Getting proper equipment remains a challenge, he said. On Wednesday, Amazon\u00a0reported\u00a0the first confirmed case among its U.S. warehouse workforce \u2014 at a delivery station near New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve placed purchase orders for millions of face masks we want to give to our employees and contractors who cannot work from home, but very few of those orders have been filled,\u201d Bezos said.\n\u201cMasks remain in short supply globally and are at this point being directed by governments to the highest-need facilities like hospitals and clinics,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand why the incredible medical providers serving our communities need to be first in line. When our turn for masks comes, our first priority will be getting them in the hands of our employees and partners working to get essential products to people.\u201d\nAmazon is now one of the three most biggest U.S. companies by market value, making Bezos the world\u2019s richest man. Critics say he could do more.\n\u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d said Dania Rajendra, director of Athena, a group that advocates for hourly workers and small businesses, and a frequent critic of Amazon.\n\u201cRather than focusing on unavailable equipment, or issuing half measures that don\u2019t come close to tackling the scale of the crisis, Bezos and his corporation should make real moves that protect public and worker health, starting with the very basics, like enough time for workers to wash their hands, health coverage for everyone who needs it, and paid leave, so people who need to stay home can,\u201d she said."},"3":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tGlendale provides hand-washing stations, meals during coronavirus crisis\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/21\/glendale-provides-hand-washing-stations-meals-during-coronavirus-crisis\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/AP20065580901865-5.jpg?w=505","discription":"\nGlendale announced on Saturday, March 21, that it will provide packaged meals on a daily basis for seniors and people experiencing homelessness and deploy portable hand-washing stations and bathrooms.\nHand-washing stations are located at:\nThe bathrooms\/hand-washing stations are located at:\nAs of March 20, 2020, the meal distribution plan for seniors currently enrolled in the Elderly Nutrition Program (ENP) is as follows:\nNew Clients must fill out a universal intake form before receiving meal.

The central bank\u2019s all-out effort has now gone beyond even the extraordinary drive it made to rescue the economy from the 2008 financial crisis.\n\u201cThe coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world,\u201d the Fed said in a statement. \u201cOur nation\u2019s first priority is to care for those afflicted and to limit the further spread of the virus. While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions. Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.\u201d\nFinancial markets sharply reversed themselves after the announcement but then fell back again after the market opened. By mid-morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 1.5%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell, a sign that more investors are willing to purchase the securities.\nIn unleashing its aggressive new efforts, the Fed is trying both to stabilize the economic standstill and allay panic in financial markets. Many corporations and city and state governments are in desperate need of loans to pay bills and maintain operations as their revenue from customers or taxpayers collapses. That need has escalated demand for cash. In the meantime, large businesses have been drawing, as much as they can, on their existing borrowing relationships with banks.\nThe intensifying needs for cash means that banks and other investors are seeking to rapidly unload Treasuries, short-term corporate debt, municipal bonds and other securities. The Fed\u2019s move to step in and act as a buyer of last resort is intended provide that needed cash.\nMany economists say that whatever financial support Congress eventually provides will likely be even more important than the Fed\u2019s intervention. And they warn that such fiscal help needs to come soon.\nThe Fed\u2019s intervention is not a substitute for fiscal stimulus,\u201d said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist who is now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cLet\u2019s hope Congress passes something quickly.\u201d\nIn its announcement Monday, the Fed said it will establish three new lending facilities that will provide up to $300 billion by purchasing corporate bonds, a wider range of municipal bonds and securities tied to such debt as auto and real estate loans. It will also buy an unlimited amount of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to try to hold down borrowing rates and ensure those markets function smoothly.\nThe central bank\u2019s new go-for-broke approach is an acknowledgment that its previous plans to keep credit flowing smoothly, which included dollar limits, wouldn\u2019t be enough in the face of the viral outbreak, which has brought the U.S. economy to a near-standstill as workers and consumers stay home. Last week, it said it would buy $500 billion of Treasuries and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities, then quickly ran through roughly half those amounts by week\u2019s end of the week.\nAnd on Monday, the New York Federal Reserve said it would buy $75 billion of Treasuries and $50 billion of mortgage-backed securities each day this week.\n\u201cThey\u2019re really setting the economy up\u201d to start functioning again when the health crisis subsides, said Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chair who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cPart of this is about the other side of the valley: Make sure the credit is there.\u201d\nStill, Kohn noted, \u201cThese things will take some time to set up. These are complicated\u201d programs.\nJust knowing that the Fed is on the case should reassure businesses as the programs ramp up, Kohn said.\n\u201cThe fact that this is coming: People will know it,\u201d Kohn said. \u201cThey know the Fed is on the job. If there are issues that come up, what you\u2019re seeing from this Federal Reserve is: \u2018We will deal with it.\u2019 \u201d\nIan Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it is clear that the Fed is now doing \u201cwhatever it takes.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an all-out effort to ensure that the business sector can continue to exist even as economic activity temporarily collapses,\u201d Shepherdson said.\n\u201cThe steps announced today, combined with the previous ones \u2026 should substantially improve market functioning and should provide some important support for the economy,\u201d said Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist who is now head of global policy research at Cornerstone Macro.\nBut Perli cautioned that the benefits won\u2019t be felt immediately.\n\u201cThe next couple of quarters will still be probably bad,\u201d he said.\nThe new programs announced Monday by the Fed include two that will buy corporate debt issued by large companies. The Fed legally can\u2019t lend directly to companies. But it can lend to separate entities, which can then make those purchases.\nOne program will buy newly issued corporate debt. This is an effort to revive that market, which has effectively come to a standstill. The second will buy previously issued corporate debt. Both programs will include $10 billion provided by the Treasury to offset any losses.\nA third new lending program will buy securities backed by packages of auto loans, credit card loans and some small business loans. Lending in those areas hinges on the ability of banks to package those loans into securities and sell them. So the Fed\u2019s move is critical to the ability of banks to continue to provide these loans as the economy falters.\nThe Treasury will also provide $10 billion to that program to offset any losses. All told, those three programs can lend up to $300 billion.\nThe Fed also said it will soon establish a \u201cMain Street Business Lending Program\u201dto support lending to small and medium-sized businesses. But it provided few details and didn\u2019t say when that program would begin.\nThe central bank\u2019s efforts to protect the economy could be amplified by rescue legislation moving through Congress. Senate Republicans have proposed providing roughly $500 billion to the Treasury Department that it could use to then backstop more lending by the Fed.\nMany economists say that whatever financial support Congress eventually provides will likely be even more important than the Fed\u2019s intervention. And they warn that such fiscal help needs to come soon.\n\u201cIt is good to work with Treasury to help keep credit flowing but not a substitute for fiscal stimulus,\u201d said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist who is now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cLet\u2019s hope Congress passes something quickly.\u201d"},"7":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tBubble Watch: Coronavirus may clobber \u2018overvalued\u2019 housing markets\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/20\/bubble-watch-coronavirus-may-clobber-overvalued-housing-markets\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Screen-Shot-2020-03-20-at-10.00.51-AM-1.png?w=620","discription":"\nWith home prices looking very vulnerable to coronavirus fallout, 17 states were found to have overvalued housing in the fourth quarter, up from 15 at the end of 2018 and 14 at 2017\u2019s close.\nFitch Ratings\nAnalysts at Fitch Ratings estimate U.S. home values, when compared with their economic underpinnings, were 1.5% overvalued at the end of 2019. But the national picture showed wide variations. California home prices \u2014 up 4% last year, by Fitch\u2019s math \u2014 got a \u201csustainable\u201d rating, one of 28 states to get that a passing grade. And it\u2019s the same grade the state got a year earlier.\nWe\u2019re in uncharted waters and stuck making guesstimates based on \u201cBC\u201d data. That\u2019s stats \u201cbefore coronavirus.\u201d\nBut I\u2019ll bet that housing markets with high overvaluation are at greater risk of price reversals.\n\u201cThe broad spread of coronavirus in the U.S. will slow down home buying activity, leading to a temporary drop in demand and lower home price growth,\u201d Fitch wrote. \u201cA widespread and protracted period of containment could result in larger disruptions to local economies, higher unemployment and home price declines.\u201d\nFitch found that no state had falling prices, by its math, in the fourth quarter vs. a year earlier. So those \u201cBC\u201d days were fairly good to most homeowners. But that doesn\u2019t mean all prices were economically logical to Fitch.\nBy their analysts\u2019 math, the most overvalued housing \u2014 with prices 20% to 24% above their economic value \u2014 were found in Idaho (prices up 12% last year) and Nevada (up 4%). Next on the overvaluation scale, 15% to 19% too high, was North Dakota (up 3% in \u201919).\nOvervalued by 10% to 14% was Arizona (up 7%), Texas (up 4%) and Utah (up 8%).\nThe lowest overvaluation (5% to 9% too high) was seen in Colorado (up 6%); Florida (up 6%); Kansas (up 5%); Nebraska (up 4%); Oregon (up 5%); Rhode Island (up 6%); South Dakota (up 5%); Tennessee (up 7%); Washington (up 7%); Wisconsin (up 6%); and Wyoming (up 6%).\nSo where\u2019s the undervalued homes, by Fitch\u2019s math? Connecticut (up 2% last year); Illinois (up 2%); Maryland (up 4%); Michigan (up 5%); New Jersey (up 5%); and West Virginia (up 7%).\nAt the local level, Fitch estimates 18% of U.S. metropolitan areas have housing markets 10% or more overvalued. San Antonio, Las Vegas and Austin were the most overvalued. The region that comprises Los Angeles and Orange counties was rated \u201csustainable\u201d as were San Francisco and San Diego.\nOn a scale of zero bubbles (no bubble here) to five bubbles (five-alarm warning) \u2026 \nLet\u2019s face the harsh reality: Only a handful of industries are immune from coronavirus and its related shutdowns, bans, limitations and shortages. That means lots of job losses. And out-of-work folks don\u2019t buy homes while those who already own have trouble keeping them.\nSo places with weak economic foundations, both the overall business climate and what\u2019s backing the housing market, are more likely to fall hardest."},"8":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tNewsom calls out almost every Californian for being a NIMBY\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/02\/21\/newsom-calls-out-all-californians-for-being-nimbys\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/OCR-L-NEWSOM-0223-1.jpg?w=525","discription":"\nGive Gov.

Not to mention decades of policymakers from his political party and the other one, too.\nAnd he\u2019s 100% correct in tying inaction to self-interest. It\u2019s a natural defense mechanism against change in all situations, especially when an issue like housing puts literally trillions of dollars of wealth at stake.\n\u201cTime and time again, bigger, bolder reform hasn\u2019t happened \u2014 in part because of some legitimate concerns,\u201d \n\u201cMany of our lowest-income residents understandably worry about being pushed out of their own communities because of gentrification.

At the same time, we also know the status quo is simply unacceptable \u2014 we aren\u2019t building enough housing.\u201d\nShaming inaction is a laudable tactic. But one often unspoken challenge is that the status quo is EXACTLY what a chunk of the real estate industry wants.\nNewsom says sacrifices are needed from the homeowner who\u2019s bet their life savings on a California home. He suggests the same from the tenement-dweller who accepts their dumpy rental because there\u2019s no better option and they live one layoff or medical bill away from homelessness.\nBut what about the real estate industry?\nCalifornia is one of the nation\u2019s most-profitable places to build a home, sell or finance one or own an apartment complex. That\u2019s due, in part, to the modest supply of housing available in the state\u2019s growing economy.\nDo you expect the industry to willingly give up that profitable perch?\nNewsom and many others suggest the supply slice of the homelessness challenge is simple economics, more homes equal lower costs. But similar economic pressures suggest the state\u2019s real estate world will protect its turf in a very NIMBY way.\nIt\u2019s not just your typical Californian who doesn\u2019t want the homeless shelter or \u201caffordable\u201d housing down the block. The portfolios of big landlords and major landowners may be harmed as well.\nOr you hear of industry calls for \u201chelp\u201d to make lower-priced home construction \u201cprofitable.\u201d\nLet\u2019s look at last year\u2019s \nNewsom called for greater \u201caccountability\u201d in the housing challenges. What about this industry error?\nThe industry is good at seeking \u201chelp\u201d from the government. Requests to loosen environmental constraints and ease regulatory approvals have merit. But what of industry demands for lowering \u201cfees\u201d charged in the process?\nMany of these much-debated development fees are attempts by local governments to recoup infrastructure costs associated with new communities \u2014 schools, sewers, roads, first responders, etc. And some reasonable proposals have been floated to find state money to help lower these fees, which often are pushed all the way to the price the eventual buyer pays.\nIt\u2019s a win-win if future cuts in developer fees equal homebuyer savings and not greater profits for homebuilders.\nAnd it\u2019s not just new construction.\nWhat about the unnecessary complexity, not to mention the costs, of actually acquiring a home, new or used, or renting one. While we consider retooling state laws to make construction easier, what about regulations that could ease the acquisition and financing of housing, not to mention open up the transactions\u2019 field to new entrants in order to boost competition?\nIf California wants to really fix this problem, all stakeholders must accept change for the greater good.

Like SAG-AFTRA\u2019s, the Directors Guild of America\u2019s health plan has waived co-pays and deductibles for Coronavirus tests.\nThe Writers Guild of America, traditionally Hollywood\u2019s most contentious above-the-line union, even seems to be cooperating with the bosses\u2019 representative, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, for a change . . . If only to figure out when and how to start negotiating the writers\u2019 new contract.\nHardest and widest hit, however, are nonunionized support and office staff, as well as organized below-the-line labor, which are virtually every other skilled craftsperson necessary to make a show.\nWhile some Southern California BTL jobs are represented by Teamsters Local 399 (which is at least able to get its laid-off production drivers preferential employment for one of the few booming businesses in the new corona economy, transporting food and goods to besieged grocery stores), the majority of rank-and-file film and live production workers are members of various International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees locals.\nThe International has projected that 120,000 of its 150,000 members in the U.S. and Canada are now unemployed because of the coronavirus shutdown. Many of those professionals go from show to show, and therefore do not meet some of the past-employment requirements Congress\u2019 emergency relief legislation requires. IATSE is furiously lobbying lawmakers to take the unique circumstances of entertainment workers into consideration as other rounds of aid packages move forward.\n\u201cGiven the fast pace and freelance nature of the entertainment industry, a lot of entertainment workers \u2013 not all of them \u2013 wouldn\u2019t qualify for extended benefits because they don\u2019t meet the days worked for a particular employer requirements of that law,\u201d Jonas Loeb, IATSE\u2019s director of communications, explained.\nIn the meantime, IATSE has been contributing to charities, such as the Actors Fund, that its members can access for aid, and moving to see what the also income-squeezed employers, from the major studios like Disney to single-show independent producers, can do to help the idled rank-and-file.\n\u201cThe IATSE is working with employers and looking at all of our contracts for pertinent clauses,\u201d Loeb said. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting around the clock on every possible front.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s unclear what many individual outfits in the vast array of production and distribution entities can and\/or are willing to do to support workers through the shutdown, at least the one major player that hasn\u2019t \n\u201cAlmost all television and film production has now ceased globally \u2013 leaving hundreds of thousands of crew and cast without jobs. These include electricians, carpenters and drivers, many of whom are paid hourly wages and work on a project-to-project basis,\u201d Netflix\u2019s chief content officer Ted Sarandos wrote in a company blog post announcing the fund. He added that for Netflix\u2019s pros, \u201cThis is in addition to the two weeks pay we\u2019ve already committed to the crew and cast on productions we were forced to suspend last week.\u201d\nEven those who are getting a few weeks\u2019 severance will need help to stay solvent through a pandemic it will likely take months to outlast.\n\u201cYou have to assume that there will be some companies that are able to provide some kind of support to the staff that is not working as a result of these shutdowns,\u201d FilmLA president Paul Audley observed. \u201cAnd there\u2019s some that can\u2019t, so like every other industry in the region, it\u2019s going to be devastating for individuals and really hard for the overall economy. That\u2019s why we all hope, in the global picture here in the United States, that some of the federal and state initiatives come through to help support the individuals in this business through what could be a fairly long period of time of no work.\u201d\nAudley said that his film office for the city and county saw a huge drop in location shooting permit requests since most major productions announced that they were shutting down late in the second week of March. By last Wednesday, no permits were being requested, and on Friday they were forbidden until at least March 31, with extensions beyond then likely.\nBeside talent, crew and producers getting strangled by the production shutdown, hundreds of independent service vendors \u2013 from those who provide talent trailers and cameras to set caterers and florists \u2013 are seeing their small businesses hit a wall.\n\u201cVendors are, obviously, suffering greatly,\u201d Audley noted. \u201cSo much of this business is margin-based, they don\u2019t have months and months of runout time. We have grave concern that some of these people could be history.\u201d\nA similar fate could be looming for many independent producers, traditionally the impresarios who find and give new talent their break in the industry.\n\u201cThe studios, the bigger companies will survive,\u201d Milken\u2019s Klowden asserted. \u201cIt\u2019s some of the independent producers that are a concern. That problem is true not just in the movie industry but in a lot of small business. When you operate without a lot of reserves, when you operate with smaller margins, then this winds up being a huge, cash-crunch problem.\u201d\nWhile David M. Smith, a professor of economics at Pepperdine University\u2019s Graziadio Business School agreed that a work stoppage beyond 12 weeks would be terribly hard for individuals and an existential threat to smaller companies, he did think that Hollywood\u2019s skilled workers will right their career ships if they can weather the current storm.\n\u201cSome of these workers are very valuable, and I\u2019m sure the studios are taking that into consideration and may help some of these individuals over time,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be pent-up demand for entertainment when things do get back to normal. For some small businesses like a small hotel or restaurant, there may be a question of whether there\u2019s going to be a job to go back to. For these workers, there will likely be jobs. Good, below-the-line workers are in high demand.\u201d\nFilmLA\u2019s Audley saw another ray of optimism in the now totally gone-dark picture.\n\u201cThe studios have all suspended their work and they\u2019re not setting a date by which they believe they\u2019ll be back out,\u201d Audley acknowledged. \u201cBut one thing to think about for the entertainment industry versus a lot of others is that it can start working the next day after clearance, because they\u2019re that flexible and mobile.\u201d\nOverall, though, Southern California can expect one of its signature industries to mean just a fraction of what it did to the area\u2019s economy until this pandemic abates.\n\u201cIt becomes one more piece on top of what is already a very complex, frustrating situation,\u201d Klowden concluded. \u201cAs far as oddities, you had seen that a certain amount of the port activity had been in a slump because of the trade war and, then, the Chinese isolation. Now that Chinese production is coming back online, that\u2019s showing signs of starting to recover. But that\u2019s going to wind up running into the production shutdown in entertainment and the hospitality and tourism industries.\n\u201cThey\u2019re all going to be hit together, and that\u2019s going to affect people in both lower and higher incomes. It\u2019s going to stretch the problem throughout Southern Californian society,\u201d Klowden said."}}
