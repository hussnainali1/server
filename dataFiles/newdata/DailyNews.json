Is it safe to wait in line with others to enter a grocery store? Is it best to cross the street if a neighbor is also out for a walk?\nLocal public health officials said to use common sense while practicing social distancing.\n\u201cYou cut the spread by putting people away from situations where they unconsciously end up sharing germs,\u201d said Dr. Shruti K. Gohil, associate medical director of epidemiology and infection prevention at UC Irvine Medical Center. \u201cI think we do need to stay rational and think about how to translate the new directives into our daily lives in a way that makes sense and allows us to live life while adhering to strict precautions. That is the hard part.\u201d\nHealth experts have advised keeping hands and surfaces clean when going out for essentials such as groceries, gas or a prescription. When possible, pick up items in the same trip for seniors or an immunocompromised neighbor.\nThe California Department of Public Health has recommended that shoppers stay 6 feet apart and that stores limit customers as needed to reduce crowding and lines.\nDr. Emily Blodget, an infectious disease specialist at USC\u2019s Keck School of Medicine, suggested shopping when stores are less busy to avoid long lines either outside or at checkout.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing around in line it defeats the purpose of having more space in the store,\u201d Blodget said.\nGohil said to stick to a shopping list and buy enough for a week to prevent extra trips. She said to avoid anyone who is coughing or sneezing, don\u2019t touch your face and apply hand sanitizer frequently, especially after touching common surfaces.\n\u201cIf somebody coughs across the room and they\u2019re visibly sick but they didn\u2019t cough on you and they didn\u2019t get within your 6-foot orbit, you\u2019re not considered exposed,\u201d Gohil said.\nEven if a shopper unknowingly touches a surface where a sick person has deposited respiratory secretions, proper hand cleaning can halt transmission.\n\u201cIf you do your hand hygiene you\u2019ve stopped the material from getting into your mucus membranes,\u201d Gohil said.\nBrandon Brown, an epidemiologist at UC Riverside\u2019s School of Medicine, said if consumers haven\u2019t been able to clean their hands throughout the course of their errands, they should use a disinfecting wipe to clean items they touched such as phones, credit cards, car door handles and keys. \n\u201cAnything you can use to sanitize these items that we touch before we might be touching our face is definitely useful,\u201d he said.\nBlodget said rather than simply rinsing fruits and vegetables at home, which may have been handled by other shoppers, wash them with a gentle dish soap. Washing or wiping down reusable shopping bags is also a good idea.\nWhen getting gas, Blodget suggested using a wipe to clean the keypad and pump handle. Use pharmacy drive-throughs to pick up prescriptions when possible.\nGov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home order allows for visits to care for a friend or relative. As residents remain at home, they should wash their hands often and refrain from sharing utensils or drinks with any visitors, Gohil said.\nWhen walking outside, Blodget said there\u2019s no need to cross the street if you see someone coming. It\u2019s fine to wave and say hello to a neighbor or even chat briefly while maintaining a distance.\n\u201cI think just walking around on the streets a little bit with your dog is probably OK,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a quick enough period of time that you\u2019re just walking and passing by.\u201d\nBrown said as more people shop online, it\u2019s a good idea to wash your hands after opening a box. The same goes for after receiving a food delivery.\nDespite interruptions in school and child care, now is not the time for grandparents to care for children. Doctors said to avoid visits with kids to ensure no one gets sick during these early days of social distance.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still learning about how long you\u2019re actually infectious after you get sick,\u201d Blodget said.\nThe California Dental Association has recommended that dental offices temporarily suspend non-urgent dental care. Routine medical visits should also be rescheduled.\nGohil said that hospitals have processes in place to screen and isolate potentially ill patients to avoid unnecessary exposures to others needing medical care, such as chemotherapy patients or women going into labor.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s something that\u2019s essential for your survival, we have protections in place,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have ways we keep our spaces in the hospital as clean as possible.\u201d\nAs residents take precautions, Brown said he prefers the term \u201cphysical distancing\u201d to remind people that it\u2019s vital to remain connected through virtual communication such as video chat.\n\u201cSince we\u2019re social beings, we need to see each other to talk and discuss,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe need to tackle feelings of isolation and depression that could come at this time when we\u2019re forced to be at home to halt the pandemic.\u201d"},"3":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tUCI researchers will test former Ebola drug as part of coronavirus clinical trial\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/23\/uci-researchers-will-test-former-ebola-drug-as-part-of-coronavirus-clinical-trial\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/OCR-L-VIRUS-CLINICAL-0323-lede-PB-1.jpg?w=620","discription":"\nEverybody is hoping for a miracle drug to treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the infectious novel coronavirus.\nNow, researchers at UC Irvine have a shot at helping to find it.\nAs part of a national clinical trial, the Orange County team of medical scientists are authorized to use the anti-viral drug remdesivir \u2014 once developed to treat the Ebola virus \u2014 on certain COVID-19 patients hospitalized at UCI Medical Center in Orange. The study\u2019s goal, over an unspecified period of time, will be to determine the drug\u2019s effectiveness against a disease that has already killed more than 11,000 people.\nThe research is being led by Dr. Alpesh N. Amin, chair of UCI School of Medicine\u2019s Department of Medicine and executive director of the UCI Health Hospitalist\u00a0Program and fellow principal investigator Dr. Lanny Hsieh, an infectious disease specialist.\n\u201cThe exciting thing is that UCI is on the cutting edge of making this available to our patients,\u201d Amin said. \u201cWe want to be there. We want to make sure we have the right therapeutic options.\u201d\nAs of Friday, March 20, when Amin spoke to The Orange County Register about the study, UCI Medical Center had two COVID-19 patients. In both cases, eligibility for the trial was being determined.\nThere is no known treatment at this point for COVID-19. Scientists around the world are racing to find something that can arrest the mild to severe respiratory symptoms and illness that can lead to pneumonia and, in the case of older adults and people with compromised immune systems, higher rates of death.\nRemdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences Inc., is among the potential drug therapies highlighted in recent news briefings by the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The antiviral drug, administered intravenously, also is being studied in COVID-19 clinical trials in China, where the novel coronavirus emerged late last year.\nIt has been shown to be safe for use in humans and has had success as a coronavirus treatment.\nIn January, it was administered under \u201ccompassionate use\u201d to a Washington state man who had developed pneumonia related to COVID-19; he recovered. In late February, doctors at UC Davis Medical Center treated a critically ill COVID-19 patient with remdesivir, also under compassionate use. In a \nAnd last week, a 79-year-old patient in Italy, where the COVID-19 death toll has exceeded that of China, was declared cured by the drug.\nGilead, headquartered in San Mateo County, developed remdesivir as a potential treatment for the West African Ebola virus, but a 2018 clinical trial found two other drugs to be more effective. Gilead\u2019s own tests have shown the drug\u2019s promise in treating two other coronavirus infections, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.\nUCI Health \u2014 the combined clinical, medical and research arms of UC Irvine \u2014 last week\u00a0joined counterparts at UC Davis and UC San Diego in research sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. The federal agency first began enrolling coronavirus patients for the study in February, at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.\nThe trial is open only to hospitalized patients with what the NIH refers to as \u201claboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection\u201d showing evidence of \u201clung involvement that includes rattling sounds when breathing (rales) with a need for supplemental oxygen or abnormal chest X-rays, or illness requiring mechanical ventilation.\u201d\nPatients who are asymptomatic, or who have only mild cold-like symptoms, are excluded from the trial.\nAmin said the investigators will assess the trial\u2019s progress after the first 100 patients have enrolled across the 20 open sites.\nParticipants will randomly be assigned to receive the drug, or a placebo, in the double-blind study \u2014 meaning neither patient nor investigator will know which the participant is getting. Trial protocol calls for administering 200 mg of remdesivir on Day 1, followed by a daily maintenance dose of 100 mg for the duration of hospitalization, up to a total course of 10 days.\nUCI\u2019s Dr. Amin said he did not know how many patients the trial may ultimately involve. Here are his answers to other questions.\n When does the trial start at UCI?\n It\u2019s starting now. Currently, we\u2019re assessing the patients in house that would potentially be part of this trial.\n Are patients giving consent themselves or is it through a family member?\n\u00a0 We have an informed consent. It will either be the patient or family member, depending on the condition of the patient.\n How long will the trial last and how many patients will be involved?\n I don\u2019t know as of right now. As we enroll patients and we start seeing the outcomes that occur, that\u2019s going to give some directionality to the trial. Part of it also depends on how quickly we can enroll enough patients into the trial.\nWe don\u2019t have a good sense yet of how many patients are going to be coming into the hospital and how many of those patients can actually meet the inclusion criteria of the trial.\nIt\u2019s a little bit of a different thing than maybe other trials where you kind of have a good sense of the disease burden. We\u2019re trying to understand the level of disease burden because it\u2019s so new. We\u2019re also on the cutting edge of trying to get the right therapy for managing that disease.\nSo it\u2019s going to be a little bit of fluid decision making in terms of the length for the trial and how many patients we actually enroll across the country. If you ask me in a month or two, I might have a little bit better answer.\n Is this one of several trials going on in the U.S. or is it all one big trial in different states?\n There are other trials that are either in motion or already have started. This one is specific about using remdesivir for the treatment of acutely ill hospitalized patients, compared to a placebo.\nWe\u2019re still trying to learn what potential therapies will actually work against COVID-19. We\u2019re talking about other potential therapy adoptions, so those will have their own trials.\u00a0It\u2019s a dynamic situation right now.\n How is efficacy determined; how will you know the drug is working?\n Efficacy is determined by improvement of clinical symptoms and how quickly the clinical symptoms improve. Then ultimately, the efficacy is looking at the mortality. Is there a survivability difference between patients that take the drug versus patients that don\u2019t?\n To what extent has this particular drug been used on COVID-19 patients?\n It\u2019s been tried experimentally. I don\u2019t know how many countries off the top of my head. While remdesivir has shown some promise, we need some clinical data to indicate some improvements for infected patients.\n If this drug shows success, how soon could it be used as a therapy? What are the next steps?\n If the study shows that (successful treatment) can be done, then it would go for FDA application. The FDA would review the data and based on the data, the FDA could give approval to the manufacturing company.\nIt\u2019s basically breaking down some processes and barriers that would have taken longer in other situations. Given the situation that we are in collectively, I think the FDA would move very fast."},"4":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tFed to buy as much government debt as needed to aid coronavirus-battered economy\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/23\/fed-to-buy-as-much-government-debt-as-needed-to-aid-coronavirus-battered-economy\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/AP20077545642902-1.jpg?w=525","discription":"\n | \nWASHINGTON \u2014 In its boldest effort to protect the U.S. economy from the coronavirus, the Federal Reserve says it will buy as much government debt as it deems necessary and will also begin lending to small and large businesses and local governments to help them weather the crisis.\nThe Fed\u2019s announcement Monday removes any dollar limits from its plans to support the flow of credit through an economy that has been ravaged by the viral outbreak. The central bank\u2019s all-out effort has now gone beyond even the extraordinary drive it made to rescue the economy from the 2008 financial crisis.\n\u201cThe coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world,\u201d the Fed said in a statement. \u201cOur nation\u2019s first priority is to care for those afflicted and to limit the further spread of the virus. While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions. Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.\u201d\nFinancial markets sharply reversed themselves after the announcement but then fell back again after the market opened. By mid-morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 1.5%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell, a sign that more investors are willing to purchase the securities.\nIn unleashing its aggressive new efforts, the Fed is trying both to stabilize the economic standstill and allay panic in financial markets. Many corporations and city and state governments are in desperate need of loans to pay bills and maintain operations as their revenue from customers or taxpayers collapses. That need has escalated demand for cash. In the meantime, large businesses have been drawing, as much as they can, on their existing borrowing relationships with banks.\nThe intensifying needs for cash means that banks and other investors are seeking to rapidly unload Treasuries, short-term corporate debt, municipal bonds and other securities. The Fed\u2019s move to step in and act as a buyer of last resort is intended provide that needed cash.\nMany economists say that whatever financial support Congress eventually provides will likely be even more important than the Fed\u2019s intervention. And they warn that such fiscal help needs to come soon.\nThe Fed\u2019s intervention is not a substitute for fiscal stimulus,\u201d said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist who is now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cLet\u2019s hope Congress passes something quickly.\u201d\nIn its announcement Monday, the Fed said it will establish three new lending facilities that will provide up to $300 billion by purchasing corporate bonds, a wider range of municipal bonds and securities tied to such debt as auto and real estate loans. It will also buy an unlimited amount of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to try to hold down borrowing rates and ensure those markets function smoothly.\nThe central bank\u2019s new go-for-broke approach is an acknowledgment that its previous plans to keep credit flowing smoothly, which included dollar limits, wouldn\u2019t be enough in the face of the viral outbreak, which has brought the U.S. economy to a near-standstill as workers and consumers stay home. Last week, it said it would buy $500 billion of Treasuries and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities, then quickly ran through roughly half those amounts by week\u2019s end of the week.\nAnd on Monday, the New York Federal Reserve said it would buy $75 billion of Treasuries and $50 billion of mortgage-backed securities each day this week.\n\u201cThey\u2019re really setting the economy up\u201d to start functioning again when the health crisis subsides, said Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chair who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cPart of this is about the other side of the valley: Make sure the credit is there.\u201d\nStill, Kohn noted, \u201cThese things will take some time to set up. These are complicated\u201d programs.\nJust knowing that the Fed is on the case should reassure businesses as the programs ramp up, Kohn said.\n\u201cThe fact that this is coming: People will know it,\u201d Kohn said. \u201cThey know the Fed is on the job. If there are issues that come up, what you\u2019re seeing from this Federal Reserve is: \u2018We will deal with it.\u2019 \u201d\nIan Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it is clear that the Fed is now doing \u201cwhatever it takes.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an all-out effort to ensure that the business sector can continue to exist even as economic activity temporarily collapses,\u201d Shepherdson said.\n\u201cThe steps announced today, combined with the previous ones \u2026 should substantially improve market functioning and should provide some important support for the economy,\u201d said Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist who is now head of global policy research at Cornerstone Macro.\nBut Perli cautioned that the benefits won\u2019t be felt immediately.\n\u201cThe next couple of quarters will still be probably bad,\u201d he said.\nThe new programs announced Monday by the Fed include two that will buy corporate debt issued by large companies. The Fed legally can\u2019t lend directly to companies. But it can lend to separate entities, which can then make those purchases.\nOne program will buy newly issued corporate debt. This is an effort to revive that market, which has effectively come to a standstill. The second will buy previously issued corporate debt. Both programs will include $10 billion provided by the Treasury to offset any losses.\nA third new lending program will buy securities backed by packages of auto loans, credit card loans and some small business loans. Lending in those areas hinges on the ability of banks to package those loans into securities and sell them. So the Fed\u2019s move is critical to the ability of banks to continue to provide these loans as the economy falters.\nThe Treasury will also provide $10 billion to that program to offset any losses. All told, those three programs can lend up to $300 billion.\nThe Fed also said it will soon establish a \u201cMain Street Business Lending Program\u201dto support lending to small and medium-sized businesses. But it provided few details and didn\u2019t say when that program would begin.\nThe central bank\u2019s efforts to protect the economy could be amplified by rescue legislation moving through Congress. Senate Republicans have proposed providing roughly $500 billion to the Treasury Department that it could use to then backstop more lending by the Fed.\nMany economists say that whatever financial support Congress eventually provides will likely be even more important than the Fed\u2019s intervention. And they warn that such fiscal help needs to come soon.\n\u201cIt is good to work with Treasury to help keep credit flowing but not a substitute for fiscal stimulus,\u201d said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist who is now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cLet\u2019s hope Congress passes something quickly.\u201d"},"5":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tPG&E pleads guilty in Butte County fatal fire case\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/23\/pge-pleads-guilty-criminal-charges-fatal-2018-camp-fire-butte-county-wildfire\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/SJM-L-PULGAPGE-1113-6-1.jpg?w=542","discription":"\nBay Area News Group\nPG&E on Monday disclosed it has pleaded guilty to scores of criminal charges arising from the deadly Camp Fire of 2018 that roared through Butte County, an inferno caused by the disgraced utility.\nUnder the agreement that PG&E reached with the state of California and the Butte County District Attorney\u2019s Office, PG&E admitted its guilt in the Camp Fire, which caused 85 fatalities, according to a regulatory filing by PG&E with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\u201cSubject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the utility has agreed to plead guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count of unlawfully causing a fire,\u201d PG&E stated in the SEC filing."},"6":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tLAUSD to extend school closures through May, says Beutner, amid coronavirus spread\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/23\/lausd-to-extend-school-closures-through-may-says-beutner-amid-coronavirus-spread\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/LDN-L-VIRUS-LAUSD-0314-DM-08-2.jpg?w=620","discription":"\nLos Angeles Unified School District Supt.

Students Most in Need, which now has a \n\u201cI wound up in a conversation with a couple of foundations, including Pritzker last weekend, and he said, \u2018We\u2019d like to help.\u2019 This crisis has presented a unique opportunity for folks like Tony Pritzker (heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune) to step up and say, \u2018Hey, we do care about public education.\u2019\u201d\nDonors thus far include the Anthony and Jeanne Pritzker Family Foundation, the Ballmer Group and Richard Lovett, president of Creative Artists Agency, at $250,000 each. Actor Matthew McConaughey and the Creative Artists Agency also have committed to contribute.\nBeutner, who has long talked about the dearth of philanthropic involvement at LAUSD despite being home to a city with such high concentration of wealth, said the funds will be used for daily meal distribution and to provide digital devices and other resources for \nL.A. Unified, where 80% of the 600,000 students are low-income, is certainly a district serving families in need as crisis hits. Some 17,000 of its students are homeless and 24,000 have moderate to severe disabilities, according to district figures.\nBetween Wednesday and Thursday at \nThe few past days have seen colossal developments in the future of California schools, including a \nSuperintendent Beutner said he will issue an update on closures and distance learning efforts on Monday. Meanwhile, amid state- and county-ordered \u201cStay at Home\u201d directives issued Thursday, all 60 Grab and Go Food Centers operated by Los Angeles Unified will be open on Friday, March 20. The orders allow essential services like food centers to remain open.\nBusinesses have stepped up to provide broadband access and public programming for students on television, yet many educators have described the current distance learning situation as inconsistent and woefully inadequate as they confront a steep online instruction learning curve.\n\u201cIt is a disaster for everyone including, us, teachers,\u201d said Nancy Madrid, a teacher at Vinedale College Preparatory Academy in Sun Valley, in a post to other teachers and parents on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s only the first week. Kids also need to adjust as do we. I am zooming with my students and is not ideal. We are still trying to figure it out. It will get better!\u201d\nStudents are home with homework packets, and a number of laptops and tablets have gone home with students to communicate with teachers using an online learning management system called Schoology. On social media, some teachers called the transition a \u201cdisaster\u201d and asked for understanding as many learn Zoom or Google conferencing.\nL.A. Unified has estimated 50% of its students lack digital tools, such as a computer or tablet, to participate in online curriculum, and 25% of families lack access to the internet at home. Requests to the district for the number of devices issued to students went unanswered.\nBut as cases of COVID-19 \u2014 the sometimes deadly respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus \u2014 climb as more tests come online and job losses mount, questions about how schools are going to teach the district\u2019s many English learners and students with disabilities have become even more pressing.\nFormer district board member David Tokofsky called the distance learning situation, not just at L.A. Unified but such neighboring districts as Burbank, Glendale and Santa Clarita, \u201cpathetic.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous. If you look at the AP teachers, maybe a student figured out for the teacher how to use Zoom. And some really dedicated teachers are doing their thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most of them are going to say, \u2018How can I teach if all my students are at home?\u2019 They\u2019re getting paid to stay home through June.\u201d\nAs one of the more fortunate educators, with some 70% of her students at home using a Chromebook, Canoga Park High School teacher Shannon Higgins-Tobar has had a more positive experience. Many students are confronting irregularities between classes and teachers, she said, but distance learning is getting easier and more streamlined every day.\n\u201cI think more and more teachers are catching on to using things like Zoom. We\u2019re all learning from each other,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not techy at all, and I\u2019m doing it. And now that we\u2019re going to be doing this for more than two weeks, I think we\u2019ll see the superintendent direct admin to get us to submit some type of curriculum.\u201d\nDawn Hamilton, a parent of a third grade student with severe disabilities at CHIME Institute, an affiliated charter school in Woodland Hills, said she knows there will be stumbling blocks as teachers, students and families figure things out. Even with distance learning slated to begin at the school next week, lesson plans sent home have been slow going.\n\u201cEven just in the first few days, I\u2019ve realized I need to lower my expectations and not expect myself to get as much done as the teachers and therapists were doing at school,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be the big thing, slowing down and doing the best I can because we also have to take care of ourselves too.\u201d"},"8":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tIs surfing OK during coronavirus order to keep your distance from others?

Others say they will be keeping out of the water all together.\nIn Spain, Italy and Portugal, where the coronavirus has hit hard, surfing and going to the beach has been banned.\nSurfrider Foundation staff scientist Katie Day, who recently attended a Coronavirus Research Update webinar hosted by the Water Research Foundation,\n\u201cThe virus has been shown to remain viable and infectious, at least temporarily, in natural freshwater environments including lakes and streams,\u201d she wrote, noting the dilution is suspected to keep the risk low. \u201cThere was no information shared on the ability of the COVID-19 virus to remain viable in saltwater, so it\u2019s unclear if swimming at saltwater beaches elevates the risk of contracting COVID-19. However, communal spread is a serious issue so spending time at popular beaches, if in close contact to other beachgoers, will increase your risk.\u201d\nSome risk may come from exposure to sewage pollution that could happen with sewage spills \u2013 which could also expose surfers to fecal-borne pathogens that can cause symptoms such as stomach upset; ear, eyes, nose and throat infections; as well as more severe infections, she noted.\n\u201cEven if recreating in sewage-polluted waterways is determined not to be a transmission route for COVID-19, it could still expose you to other pathogens which could reduce your overall immune system,\u201d she wrote.\nDr. Matthew Waxman, associate clinical professor of emergency medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA who also works with Los Angeles County officials, said he believes surfing falls into the recreational activities allowed \u2013 so long as surfers can successfully distance themselves in the water.\n\u201cI\u2019d pick a less crowded spot, ride alone in the car and make it a small family or solo trip,\u201d he said. \u201cBig key would be to keep the distance in the water and not being tempted to chat in the line up.\u201d\nBasically, keep in line with the key recommendation for safe recreating: Maintain social distancing.\nWaxman noted he would be concerned, however, about surfing after the rain in general because of known coliforms such as fecal matter and other toxins that get washed in the water. It\u2019s unknown if fecal matter would transmit the virus in salt water.\nMany surfers surveyed on social media were torn on the question of whether to surf or not to surf.\n\u201cWe are all being called to make some sacrifices for the good of many,\u201d said Steven Barnes. \u201cYes surfing is an outdoor activity, but at times it can be uncontrolled by its very nature, walking on the other hand or taking a jog is far less so. If you are walking or jogging, don\u2019t spit on the ground for someone else to walk in. Everyone just use some common sense and we\u2019ll get through this.\n\u201cThe ocean will be there in a few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster we tamp this thing down the quicker we can get back to our normal lives.\u201d\nDon Ramsey said he\u2019s \u201cstayin\u2019 out of the water,\u201d figuring there is already a lot of bacteria increasing the chance of getting sick, \u201cand then you get the coronavirus, and you\u2019re older like me, my chances of survival decrease.\u201d\nSurfing is exercise for David Olive, who also finds saltwater to be beneficial for his health. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to breathe fresh air!\u201d\nSo far,\u00a0Stephanie Aguilar said she has found that people seem to be \u201cgiving each other space in the water and on the beach.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s outdoors with plenty of air flowing around everyone, and with all of the stress of this situation surfing is probably a very healthy outlet for people, as long as they are giving each other space,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as playground equipment where you touch contaminated surfaces or being indoors with people where you could be walking through people\u2019s coughs and sneezes.\u201d\nEmmy Moreau said she thinks even surfers need to heed the stay at home order.\n\u201cI interpreted the whole exercise thing as walking around your own neighborhood alone,\u201d she said. \u201cSurfing is also a higher risk activity and sends some to the hospital or urgent care and we don\u2019t need that right now.\u201d\nBut she also added a positive message for her fellow wave riders: \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this!\u201d"},"9":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tNo coronavirus cases reported by LA Metro as ridership dips 60%\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/20\/no-coronavirus-cases-reported-by-la-metro-as-ridership-dips-60\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/LDN-L-VIRUS-COMMUTERS-0318-DC-1-3.jpg?w=525","discription":"\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority vowed to continue providing bus and train service during the \n\u201cOur focus now is to keep the system open anyway we can,\u201d LA Metro CEO Phil Washington said Friday, March 20, in a news briefing. \u201cWe have no plans to shut down our system.\u201d\nIn February, the system served about 30 million passengers via bus, rail and vanpools.
