Others say they will be keeping out of the water all together.\nIn Spain, Italy and Portugal, where the coronavirus has hit hard, surfing and going to the beach has been banned.\nSurfrider Foundation staff scientist Katie Day, who recently attended a Coronavirus Research Update webinar hosted by the Water Research Foundation,\n\u201cThe virus has been shown to remain viable and infectious, at least temporarily, in natural freshwater environments including lakes and streams,\u201d she wrote, noting the dilution is suspected to keep the risk low. \u201cThere was no information shared on the ability of the COVID-19 virus to remain viable in saltwater, so it\u2019s unclear if swimming at saltwater beaches elevates the risk of contracting COVID-19. However, communal spread is a serious issue so spending time at popular beaches, if in close contact to other beachgoers, will increase your risk.\u201d\nSome risk may come from exposure to sewage pollution that could happen with sewage spills \u2013 which could also expose surfers to fecal-borne pathogens that can cause symptoms such as stomach upset; ear, eyes, nose and throat infections; as well as more severe infections, she noted.\n\u201cEven if recreating in sewage-polluted waterways is determined not to be a transmission route for COVID-19, it could still expose you to other pathogens which could reduce your overall immune system,\u201d she wrote.\nDr. Matthew Waxman, associate clinical professor of emergency medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA who also works with Los Angeles County officials, said he believes surfing falls into the recreational activities allowed \u2013 so long as surfers can successfully distance themselves in the water.\n\u201cI\u2019d pick a less crowded spot, ride alone in the car and make it a small family or solo trip,\u201d he said. \u201cBig key would be to keep the distance in the water and not being tempted to chat in the line up.\u201d\nBasically, keep in line with the key recommendation for safe recreating: Maintain social distancing.\nWaxman noted he would be concerned, however, about surfing after the rain in general because of known coliforms such as fecal matter and other toxins that get washed in the water. It\u2019s unknown if fecal matter would transmit the virus in salt water.\nMany surfers surveyed on social media were torn on the question of whether to surf or not to surf.\n\u201cWe are all being called to make some sacrifices for the good of many,\u201d said Steven Barnes. \u201cYes surfing is an outdoor activity, but at times it can be uncontrolled by its very nature, walking on the other hand or taking a jog is far less so. If you are walking or jogging, don\u2019t spit on the ground for someone else to walk in. Everyone just use some common sense and we\u2019ll get through this.\n\u201cThe ocean will be there in a few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster we tamp this thing down the quicker we can get back to our normal lives.\u201d\nDon Ramsey said he\u2019s \u201cstayin\u2019 out of the water,\u201d figuring there is already a lot of bacteria increasing the chance of getting sick, \u201cand then you get the coronavirus, and you\u2019re older like me, my chances of survival decrease.\u201d\nSurfing is exercise for David Olive, who also finds saltwater to be beneficial for his health. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to breathe fresh air!\u201d\nSo far,\u00a0Stephanie Aguilar said she has found that people seem to be \u201cgiving each other space in the water and on the beach.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s outdoors with plenty of air flowing around everyone, and with all of the stress of this situation surfing is probably a very healthy outlet for people, as long as they are giving each other space,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as playground equipment where you touch contaminated surfaces or being indoors with people where you could be walking through people\u2019s coughs and sneezes.\u201d\nEmmy Moreau said she thinks even surfers need to heed the stay at home order.\n\u201cI interpreted the whole exercise thing as walking around your own neighborhood alone,\u201d she said. \u201cSurfing is also a higher risk activity and sends some to the hospital or urgent care and we don\u2019t need that right now.\u201d\nBut she also added a positive message for her fellow wave riders: \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this!\u201d"},"4":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tSylmar Courthouse to close for 3 days after positive test for coronavirus\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/22\/sylmar-courthouse-to-close-for-3-days-after-positive-test-for-coronavirus\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/RPE-L-VIRUS-TESTING-0321-WP16-3.jpg?w=525","discription":"\nSylmar Courthouse will be closed for three days, beginning Monday, March 23, after a deputy public defender tested positive for coronavirus.\n the closure Sunday, March 22, after learning Saturday that an attorney assigned to the Public Defender\u2019s Office last week tested positive after caring for a relative who also tested positive.\nIn accordance with public health office guidelines, affected judges and staff will self-quarantine for 14 days, the court\u2019s\u00a0 press release said.\nThe Sylmar Courthouse, which handles juvenile delinquency cases exclusively in two courtrooms, will re-open Thursday.\nBoth courtrooms have been cleaned and disinfected and it will be done again on Monday.\n and suspended all civil and criminal trials. allowing only what he called \u201csensitive and essential functions, including restraining orders, bail and parole review, grand jury indictments and probate guardianship.\n\/\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"},"5":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tOn your own in the coronavirus era?

There are the youngsters she\u2019s got to give a talking to. The \u201cGood Morning, Ms. Ford!\u201d greetings are bouncing off campus walls. The \u201ctardy parties\u201d (rewards for good attendance). There\u2019s just the act of solving problems.\nBut on this Friday \u2014 the day after the shut down of an entire state, following major parts of the world \u2014 there was relative silence.\nFor Ford, it was an epic reminder that, aside from her faithful canine companion, a 5-year-old Maltese called Coconut, she was on her own. Living on her own in the era of the coronovirus \u2014 which shut down operations at her school, and basically everything around her in her Long Beach neighborhood.\nOf course, she does have some work to do. After her school\u2019s normal functions shut down last week, she\u2019s mostly alone on a campus, making sure the students in the meal program get fed, helping with community problems \u2014 all from a distance these days. Paperwork.\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, you go home, and you\u2019re like, wow this is really scary,\u201d she said Friday, as she spent time with Coconut. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anyone to kind of unwind with.\u201d\nBeing alone is one of many struggles, of course, across the world, as the pandemic spreads. And it could be worse. You could have lost your job. You may not know if you still have a job, as many businesses shut down. You could be sick, or worse. But as the late Mother Theresa is quoted as saying: \u201cLoneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty.\u201d\nAnd in the storm of a pandemic, there\u2019s a lot of people on their own at the moment \u2014 distanced from other people after governments from Orange County to the Inland Empire to Los Angeles instituted their own restrictions shutting down essential businesses and facilities. And of course, Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s order for California residents to stay at home sealed the deal.\nFor now? No more eating out. No more malls. Parks and playground, no. No more movie theaters. There are prohibitions on how many can gather outside a home, and couple with social distancing, even gatherings with fewer people than that can be awkward these days.\nBottom line, the seismic social shift has left millions \u2014 many of them alone \u2014 at least physically in their homes, away from the people we work and play with.\n\u201cI miss that. That\u2019s my energy source. I have no energy,\u201d said Ford, echoing many.\nBut there are other reminders of just how this is affecting people, Kita S. Curry \u2014 PhD, and president of Culver City-based \nBetween her organization\u2019s suicide prevention and disaster distress hotlines, there were two coronavirus calls in January, 15 in March and 488 up to the middle of this month, she said.\nStill \u2026 God bless Mother Theresa, but experts say even our isolation doesn\u2019t have to be a \u201cterrible poverty.\u201d You can flip it around, empowering yourself, and others \u2014 even in a world where uncertainty and illness is changing hour by hour.\nSingle myself, I reached out to Curry and to Dr. Kelly Greco, assistant director for outreach and prevention services at USC\u2019s Counseling and Mental Health Services and clinical associate professor at Keck School of Medicine\u2019s Department of Psychiatry \u2014 for some wisdom.\nHere are themes they shared on how to protect your mental health as we go through this thing. Note: these are good for all of us, single, family, friends, lovers, moms, dads, grandmas, grandpas.\nFirst off. Underpinning much of that wisdom was the idea of control, or the lack of it.\nFord admits it. In general, she likes to be out doing stuff, and these days it\u2019s not easy.\n\u201cI\u2019m anxious as all can be,\u201d she said of her zest for being out of the house.\nA bit of a wanderer, she\u2019d planned a trip to Paris that she\u2019s canceled. She\u2019s the one at the local restaurant, making conversations and meeting people.\u00a0 She\u2019s still getting used to not doing that.\nThe anxiety is there.\n\u201cAdmittedly I spent three hours hitting refresh on Twitter last night,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not healthy.\u201d She\u2019s been trying to knock it down her screen time in the new normal.\nI can totally relate.\nBut she\u2019s also smiling. She still relishes the chance to wave to parents and students, when she\u2019s at the campus. She\u2019s calling her mom every day. She\u2019s even planning a virtual happy hour next week with friends.\nShe\u2019s doing stuff that Curry said is healthy in the anxious moment we\u2019re in.\n\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re standing up to the isolation that we need to follow by finding ways to touch people,\u201d Curry said. \u201cAnd there are other ways to touch people (even if not physical). You can touch their heart.\u201d\nFord \u2014 like many of us on the single end of the spectrum \u2014 are working on it. But, after all that, strange to say it, we\u2019re not alone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s lonely. It\u2019s scary. But I think were all frightened,\u201d she said. People all don\u2019t want to say it. The other day I just drove to work and I just started crying.. It\u2019s just the reality of where we\u2019re at.\u201d\nI\u2019m no expert, but I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s OK to cry.\n\u00a0"},"6":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tMore rain, snow expected in Southern California\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/23\/more-rain-snow-expected-in-southern-california\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/LDN-L-STORM-RAIN-RMC-01-2.jpg?w=548","discription":"\nLOS ANGELES \u2014\u00a0A storm from Canada brought showers to Southern California overnight, triggering a mudslide in Sherman Oaks and creating winter-weather conditions in the San Gabriel Mountains, authorities said Monday.\nIn addition to Monday morning\u2019s one-and-off showers, there\u2019s a chance of showers Monday afternoon, said National Weather Service meteorologist Todd Hall.

Surrounded by people in hazmat gear, she begged for one thing: to be taken to the same hospital that was already caring for her husband, who also had novel coronavirus.\n\u201cI was getting ready to die and I wanted to be next to my husband.\u201d\nTwo hours later, the San Fernando Valley resident got her wish. Not only was she taken to the hospital that was treating her husband, Mohammad Toutounchian, but they were allowed to share a room.\nThat was in February. At the time, it wasn\u2019t certain that either would live.\nOn Wednesday, March 18, they couple returned to their home in Tarzana. They\u2019re thrilled to be alive, and to be home.\nAnd they have a hopeful message for their fellow Americans as the country embarks into uncharted waters.\nThe Toutounchians enjoy traveling, and are regulars on cruise ships. This one, which launched from Tokyo on Jan. 20, took them across Southeast Asia for two weeks.\nOn Feb. 4, they were scheduled to disembark in Yokohama and fly home. Instead, at least one of the more than 3,700 people on the ship tested positive for novel coronavirus, prompting the quarantine. Eventually, more than 700 passengers and crew members would test positive \u2013 making it at the time the largest concentration of cases outside Wuhan, China, where the virus originated.\nMohammad Toutounchian said he was among the first to be stricken.\nFarah and Mohammad Toutounchian at their home in Tarzana, CA, on Friday, Mar 20, 2020.

He initially thought it was soreness from a walk the couple took that day on the ship. Even under quarantine, passengers were allowed to briefly leave their cabins and go out for walks, a certain number at a time, as long as they kept a distance from each other.\nBut soon, he said, he also had a headache. And a runny nose. And \u201csomething in my chest.\u201d He wanted to cough, he said, but couldn\u2019t. A day later, he had a fever.\nFarah gave him Tylenol and tended to him, while phoning \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 the ship\u2019s special \u201cfever line.\u201d\u00a0 After being ignored, she says, for a couple of days, she fired off an email to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo:\n\u201cI need help and medicine.\u201d\nSoon, Japanese doctors were on the ship and testing her husband for the virus. On Feb. 11, he was taken by ambulance to\u00a0the Japanese Red Cross Hospital in Tokyo.\nBut that left Farah, 61, alone just as she was beginning to feel the same, flu-like aches and fever. Already worried for her husband, she began to worry for herself.\nFour days later, on Feb. 15, she found herself on the floor, crying, fighting against the plan to take her to a hospital that was hours away from her husband.\nEven now, she becomes emotional recalling what happened next.\n\u201cThey treated me even worse than a rat in a cage,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI was hysterical. I was not myself. I was scared. But I was not going to go.\u201d\nFor more than two hours, they tried to convince her, but they didn\u2019t try to carry her away. \u201cThey were afraid of the virus,\u201d she said.\nShe called one of their\u00a0sons in the United States, who in turn contacted the U.S. Embassy. Soon, the health workers in the hazmat suits agreed to take her to the hospital where her husband was being treated.\nThe reunion was joyful. Doctors added a bed in Mohammad\u2019s room so the couple could be together and lift each other\u2019s spirits.\n\u201cWhen I saw her,\u201d he said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried anymore.\u201d\nFarah took a photo and sent it to their\u00a0two sons, in San Diego and Kentucky.\nBut about two hours later, she fainted. And after she came to, she fainted again.\n\u201cThey put me on an IV,\u201d she said. \u201cI had been under so much pressure.\u201d\nWhile Farah was sick, Mohammad was sicker.\nHe was battling double pneumonia. For 14 days, his fever wouldn\u2019t break. Every night, he slept on towels that would become drenched in sweat. Farah changed his towels and sheets some six or seven times every day. When the doctor told them both lungs were infected, and that he might next be placed on a ventilator to help him breathe, the couple again called their sons.\n\u201cWe went over our will,\u201d Farah said. \u201cWe said, \u2018Be strong. This is what you need to do.\u2019 That was the moment I realized this was it.\u201d\nBut Mohammad never needed the ventilator. And both began recovering with the help of doctors and nurses the couple can\u2019t stop praising.\n\u201cThey were wonderful,\u201d she said.\nDuring their last two weeks in the hospital, they were tested every 48 hours for the virus. They tested negative.\nOn Friday, March 13 \u2013 the day President Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 Mohammad was removed from the government\u2019s no fly list. On Monday, March 16, Farah got her OK to fly back home. A day later they boarded the long flight back to California.\nNow \u2013 even as California shelters in place to slow a disease that Mohammad and Farah probably won\u2019t get again \u2013 the couple are enjoying the simple things: sleeping in their own bed, sipping tea in their own kitchen, the smell of the new rain in their own backyard.\n\u201cWe look at life completely different,\u201d Farah said. \u201cComing home, and seeing the plants, knowing that spring is coming. I cherish every moment.\u201d\nMohammad, 70, said he is thankful to his wife, who made sure he was taken to the hospital and who insisted on being reunited and staying by his side. Being together, they said, made all the difference in his healing process; in \nThe couple has been married 44 years. He\u2019s an engineering consultant and she\u2019s a financial adviser. They moved to the United States from Iran about 40 years ago.\nIn normal times, they would have spent Thursday, March 19, celebrating the Persian New Year with family and friends. But not this year. And that\u2019s part of the message they want to relay to fellow Americans.\n\u201cWe have to be together,\u201d Farah said. \u201cAnd fight this virus by staying home.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s been two months since they saw family and friends \u2014 people they miss \u2014 they\u2019re OK with waiting a bit longer, until the threat of coronavirus passes. It\u2019s all part of being careful, they say, even as they add that\u00a0hysteria isn\u2019t called for.\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d Farah said. \u201cThe minute we panic, we make the wrong decision.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no need to fret over toilet paper or cupboards that aren\u2019t full. Those things, they said, will work themselves out.\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother hoarding all this food. We don\u2019t need it,\u201d Farah said\n\u201cWe have to take care of each other.\u201d\nMohammad agreed: \u201cThere is a light at the end of this darkness.\u201d\n\u201cWe are an example that things can get better,\u201d Farah said. \u201cWe went through it and we made it.\u201d\nOther Americans, she added, will make it too."},"9":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tFor law enforcement, a shift in focus and more street patrols amid coronavirus fears\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/18\/for-law-enforcement-in-la-and-other-parts-of-southern-california-a-shift-in-focus-and-more-street-patrols-amid-coronavirus-fears\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/LDN-L-COPS-VIRUS-0318-02SR-1.jpg?w=526","discription":"\nLos Angeles police Detective Brent Hopkins spends most of his days tracking down thieves who steal cars.

The last time he wore his regularly was nine years ago as a patrol officer.\n\u201cThankfully it still fits,\u201d he said. \u201cPulling that on, and sitting in a black-and-white again is going to be a very different feeling.\u201d\nIn the Los Angeles Police Department, hundreds of detectives are starting to deploy across the city as the department re-assigns them to help respond to public fear in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.\nMayor Eric Garcetti \nThe city asked LAPD to conduct \u201chigh visibility patrols at strip malls, grocery stores \u2014 anywhere where there may be a large gathering of people,\u201d said Josh Rubenstein, a police spokesman.\nTheir counterparts in the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department already are out there, too, in unincorporated areas and contract cities. It\u2019s a huge shift for public safety agencies trying to keep people calm as they line up for hours at grocery stores and wholesale markets.\nAnd it means certain crimes could go without being investigated for a while.\n\u201cWe already got help \u2014 detectives from Major Crimes, Cyber Crimes, all these specialized units,\u201d said Lt. Mark Lopez, a watch commander at the sheriff\u2019s station in La Crescenta-Montrose. \u201cWe\u2019re setting them up with deputies that are on patrol right now.\u201d\nWith a reduced workforce, most of their cases are likely to sit on their desks, collecting dust for the next few weeks.\n\u201cThey\u2019re at the bottom of a funnel \u2014 that doesn\u2019t stop because of a virus,\u201d said Sgt. Kurt Smith, a watch commander in LAPD\u2019s Valley Traffic Division, which investigates deadly crashes and hit-and-runs in the San Fernando Valley.\nPublic agencies across the country \nMost have noted there has not been an increase in reported crimes as millions stay home. At a city council meeting on Tuesday, LAPD Chief Michel Moore said both violent and property crimes were down around the city, though he noted he didn\u2019t know whether that was because of recent rains, or the effects of the virus.\nBut LAPD officials and others have said they just want to do what they can to try to quell public fear amid the outbreak.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had sparse incidents throughout the entire region, that are not medical calls,\u201d Rubenstein said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to provide a sense of security out there.\u201d\nOnly area detectives in LAPD were reassigned \u2014 specialized units were not included in the order. That means the department\u2019s homicide detectives were off limits.\nA watch commander in LAPD\u2019s Topanga Division said Monday that \u201c95 percent of our detectives are out in the field right now,\u201d headed to the Westfield Topanga Mall and other shopping centers in the area. He said that meant around 16 to 18 additional officers in uniform.\nLopez said Monday morning, four detectives from different units were out patrolling the Crescenta Valley, tagging along with patrolling officers on eight-hour shifts.\nEven though its probably been a while, most detectives spent years as beat cops before shifting to a more specialized assignment; Lopez said it wouldn\u2019t be long for most of them to remember their old habits.\n\u201cAll their instincts will come back to them,\u201d Lopez said.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies in Orange County have been given the heads up about the possibility of a similar directive.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re patrol trained then you should be patrol ready with your uniform,\u201d Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department spokeswoman Carrie Braun said.\nTo date the agency, which services most of south Orange County and unincorporated areas, hasn\u2019t put out any additional patrols but said they are prepared for the possibility at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\u201cShould we call you, you have to be ready,\u201d Braun said.\nAt the Anaheim Police Department, a similar plan exists, though Sgt. Shane Carringer said it\u2019s one that is perpetually in place for major incidents.\n\u201cWe have a strategy to allocate resources where they\u2019re needed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not out of the ordinary for us.\u201d\nOfficers have also been told to do more patrolling of shopping centers and grocery stores, where crowds have begun to gather since the virus scare but so far no significant ones have been reported.\nWith fewer cases than L.A. and Orange County, most Inland Empire law enforcement agencies haven\u2019t needed to redeploy officers yet.\nBesides requiring its officers to take precautions while out in the field, the San Bernardino Police Department hasn\u2019t dedicated any of its specialized officers for patrol duties, said Sgt. John Echevarria, a police spokesman.\nWith some court systems closed, that\u2019s freeing up deputies acting as bailiffs and transport for inmates to head out to neighborhoods or help in other areas instead.\nThe court schedule in San Bernardino County was shortened this week, so deputies assigned to courtrooms are being sent out \u201cfor extra retail patrol at grocery stores, gun stores, and any impacted retail facility,\u201d said Jodi Miller, a sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman.\nAnd the transportation deputies were reassigned to county jails, she said.\nLike many others, however, Hopkins, the Wilshire auto crime detective, has to put his regular work on hold for a virus that doesn\u2019t care about the thieves stealing wallets, purses, phones and cars.\n\u201cRight now I can\u2019t handle the guy who got his windshield smashed and his tires slashed,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI can\u2019t handle the all the dozens of people who got their cars broken into and had their property taken \u2014 we have to focus on the emergency that\u2019s confronting all of us right now.\u201d"},"10":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tDrives aim to keep historic LA restaurants alive during coronavirus outbreak\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/19\/drives-aim-to-keep-historic-la-restaurants-alive-during-coronavirus-outbreak\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/LDN-L-VIRUS-RESTAURANTS-006-0320-1.jpg?w=524","discription":"\nWith restaurants limited to takeout service or shut down completely by the coronavirus outbreak, a drive has been launched to keep some of Los Angeles\u2019 legendary eateries from fading away.\nKnown as 1933 Group, the team operates about a dozen themed bars and restaurants in Los Angeles, including the barrel-shaped bar Idle Hour in North Hollywood, Harlowe in West Hollywood, Highland Park Bowl and the Formosa Cafe in West Hollywood.\nThe Formosa Cafe is open for takeout and pick up only in West Hollywood, Thursday, March 19, 2020.
