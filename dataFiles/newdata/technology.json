As Pakistan reported three deaths and over 470 cases on Friday, the video\u2019s creator Bekaar Films is not the only profile to suddenly become the voice of public health on social media. With many people now working from home, online platforms have become up-to-the-second hubs of information (often coupled with medical misinformation) about the pandemic.   Amid viral falsehoods, a group of nearly 200 influencers in assistance with the Prime Minister Office is working to keep the public well-informed.   \u201cHi guys. From now I\u2019ll be sharing the Corona Virus updates which are authentic and coming directly from Ministry of Health to me. I request you to please don\u2019t share any fake news because it can cause panic. #ehtiyatcorona,\u201d read a post by Laraib Mehtab, who has following of 18,000 people on Twitter. Speaking to Dawn, Laraib clarified the team was working directly with the PM Office instead of the federal health ministry. \u201cThere is a lot of inauthentic information out there, including viral totkas like eating ice cream can cause corona.\u201d Amid viral falsehoods, some 200 influencers working to keep the public well-informedIn order to be part of the group, an influencer should have a following of over 10,000 followers on a social media platform (preferably Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and TikTok). Besides sharing updates, they produce creative content around a public campaign \u2014 such as one encouraging people to stay home labelled #GharParRohana. Supported, not funded\u201cMore than ever, there is a public hunger for credible information. To counter viral myths and fake news, we are utilising leading influencers who create content based on official advisories and updates from the government,\u201d Muzamil Hasan, the network leader told Dawn. The influencers part of the network said while the \u2018volunteer\u2019 initiative was supported by the PM Office, the project was unpaid. \u201cIt is an initiative started and led by the influencers themselves. The PM Office is just helping them on official updates from the centre as well as provincial and rebutting false information,\u201d Prime Minister\u2019s Focal Person on Digital Media Arslan Khalid told Dawn. \u201cTweet updates posted by media outlets and tickers are often taken out of context and create confusion or panic. The public needs to be explained things. That\u2019s what we are doing. This is a work in progress,\u201d shared Muzamil. Muzamil, who has 86.9k followers on Instagram, started the Covid coverage while working with the PM\u2019s Digital Pakistan team and reporting updates directly from the \u201cwar room\u201d established at the Ministry of National Health Services Regulation and Coordination.   Last week, Tania Aidrus shared a picture of the command and control centre at the health ministry and shared the war room had been set up where technology volunteers could collaborate with Zafar Mirza and his team. \u201cThe federal health ministry is actively helping the network disseminate official information,\u201d Muzamil added.   Fact-check risksAccording to Salman Parekh, a participating influencer \u2014 the group shares three types of content: official information (mostly regarding case numbers, and government announcements), public interest articles and material, and myth busters that is verified by the PM Office and other credible sources. \u201cThe messaging has been limited to the admins to restrict flow of information in the [WhatsApp] group. People share their concerns with us privately to verify. If there is a medical question for instance, then we ask medical experts. No information is posted by admins without verification from relevant officials,\u201d he told Dawn. The influencers research major pet-peeves and concerns in the community and find verified information to convince the public on Covid precautions. The idea of the group, he said, was to create public interest content that was culturally relevant. \u201cOur audience is local and so using our understanding we come up with content that addresses viral myths. For example, we have also created content based on vetted hadiths by religious experts to share with people who use religion to disregard all corona advisory,\u201d said Salman.Published in Dawn, March 21st, 2020"},"1":{"tilte":"SBP waives digital transaction charges\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1542048\/sbp-waives-digital-transaction-charges","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/03\/5e72df2815e76.jpg","discription":"KARACHI: In light of the coronavirus pandemic, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Wednesday waived all charges on fund transfers through online banking channels to avoid the use of cash.The move aims to minimise use of cash to contain the spread of virus amongst the bank staff and customers.Moreover, under the guidelines issued by the SBP, customers using ATMs or visiting bank branches for transferring large amounts will not incur any cost.The central bank also advised the financial sector \u201cto immediately facilitate education fee and loan repayments through internet banking or mobile devices.\u201d\u201cThe objective of these measures is to reduce the need for visiting bank branches or the ATMs and to promote use of Digital Payment Services such as internet banking, mobile phone banking etc,\u201d said the SBP in a statement.The central bank also advised banks to ensure availability of all the alternate delivery channels including ATMs, POS, internet banking, payment gateways, mobile banking and call centres for customers at all times.Published in Dawn, March 19th, 2020"},"2":{"tilte":"Tech platforms in joint effort to curb virus misinformation\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1541762\/tech-platforms-in-joint-effort-to-curb-virus-misinformation","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/03\/5e71836803441.jpg","discription":"WASHINGTON: The large US internet platforms have unveiled a joint effort to root out misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, while Facebook announced a $100 million programme to aid small firms impacted by the crisis.A joint statement was issued late on Monday by Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft and Reddit along with Google-owned YouTube and Microsoft-owned LinkedIn.\u201cWe are working closely together on COVID-19 response efforts,\u201d the joint statement said.\u201cWe\u2019re helping millions of people stay connected while also jointly combating fraud and misinformation about the virus, elevating authoritative content on our platforms, and sharing critical updates in coordination with government healthcare agencies around the world.\u201cWe invite other companies to join us as we work to keep our communities healthy and safe.\u201d Separately on Tuesday, Facebook announced it was offering $100 million to help small businesses in 30 countries cope with the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.The social networking giant said it will be giving cash grants and ad credits to as many as 30,000 enterprises.\u201cWe\u2019ve listened to small businesses to understand how we can best help them,\u201d chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said on her Facebook page.\u201cWe\u2019ve heard loud and clear that financial support could enable them to keep the lights on and pay people who can\u2019t come to work.\u201dIn a related move, Facebook agreed to offer $1 million to its partners in the International Fact-Checking Network working on the COVID-19 related misinformation with a budget of $1 million.Published in Dawn, March 18th, 2020"},"3":{"tilte":"Social media giants warn of AI moderation errors as coronavirus empties offices\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1541600\/social-media-giants-warn-of-ai-moderation-errors-as-coronavirus-empties-offices","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/03\/5e706b9169be5.jpg","discription":"Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc warned on Monday that more videos and other content could be erroneously removed for policy violations, as the companies empty offices and rely on automated takedown software during the coronavirus pandemic.In a blog post, Google said that to reduce the need for people to come into offices, YouTube and other business divisions are temporarily relying more on artificial intelligence and automated tools to find problematic content.Such software is not always as accurate as humans, which leads to errors, it added, however.

According to prime minister\u2019s focal person on digital media Dr Arslan Khalid, the cabinet had three weeks ago approved the allocation of a supplementary grant of Rs42.791 million during the current financial year for creation of a digital media wing at the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.  Media reports on Monday suggested that the digital media wing would be responsible for defending over social media any decision made by the government while also dealing with critics of the ruling PTI and explaining policies of the Imran Khan-led administration.  Refuting the claims, the PM\u2019s focal person said the reports were misleading and the digital media wing had a broader mandate. \u201cThe wing, apart from promoting the government\u2019s initiatives, will work on social media diplomacy, debunking fake news and optimisation of the digital media strategies, including advertising for campaigns,\u201d Mr Khalid told Dawn.

Assembling data gathered by eight radio telescopes around the world, astronomers created the picture showing the violent neighborhood around a supermassive black hole, the light-sucking monsters of the universe theorized by Einstein more than a century ago and confirmed by observations for decades. It looked like a flaming orange, yellow and black ring. \u201cWe have seen what we thought was unseeable. We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole. Here it is,\u201d said Sheperd Doeleman of Harvard. Read: New map of universe shows 300,000 more galaxiesJessica Dempsey, a co-discoverer and deputy director of the East Asian Observatory in Hawaii, said it reminded her of the powerful flaming Eye of Sauron from the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy. Unlike smaller black holes that come from collapsed stars, supermassive black holes are mysterious in origin. Situated at the center of most galaxies, including ours, they are so dense that nothing, not even light, can escape their gravitational pull. This one's \u201cevent horizon\u201d the point of no return around it, where light and matter begin to fall inexorably into the abyss is as big as our entire solar system. Three years ago, scientists using an extraordinarily sensitive observing system heard the sound of two much smaller black holes merging to create a gravitational wave, as Albert Einstein predicted. The new image, published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters and announced around the world in several news conferences, adds light to that sound. Outside scientists suggested the achievement could be worthy of a Nobel Prize, just like the gravitational wave discovery. While much around a black hole falls into a death spiral and is never to be seen again, the new image captures \u201clucky gas and dust\u201d circling at just far enough to be safe and seen millions of years later on Earth, Dempsey said. Taken over four days when astronomers had \u201cto have the perfect weather all across the world and literally all the stars had to align,\u201d the image helps confirm Einstein's general relativity theory, Dempsey said. Einstein a century ago even predicted the symmetrical shape that scientists just found, she said. \n\u201cIt's circular, but on one side the light is brighter,\u201d Dempsey said. That's because that light is approaching Earth. The measurements are taken at a wavelength the human eye cannot see, so the astronomers added color to the image. They chose \u201cexquisite gold because this light is so hot,\u201d Dempsey said. \u201cMaking it these warm gold and oranges makes sense.\u201d What the image shows is gas heated to millions of degrees by the friction of ever-stronger gravity, scientists said. And that gravity creates a funhouse effect where you see light from both behind the black hole and behind you as the light curves and circles around the black hole itself, said astronomer Avi Loeb, director of the Black Hole Initiative at Harvard. (The lead scientists in the discovery are from Harvard, but Loeb was not involved.)  The project cost $50 million to $60 million, with $26 million of that coming from the National Science Foundation. Johns Hopkins astrophysicist Ethan Vishniac, who was not part of the discovery team but edits the journal where the research was published, pronounced the image \u201can amazing technical achievement\u201d that \u201cgives us a glimpse of gravity in its most extreme manifestation.\u201d He added: \u201cPictures from computer simulations can be very pretty, but there's literally nothing like a picture of the real universe, however fuzzy and monochromatic.\u201d \u201cIt's just seriously cool,\u201d said John Kormendy, a University of Texas astronomer who wasn't part of the discovery team. \u201cTo see the stuff going down the tubes, so to speak, to see it firsthand. The mystique of black holes in the community is very substantial. That mystique is going to be made more real.\u201d There is a myth that says a black hole would rip you apart, but Loeb and Kormendy said the one pictured is so big, someone could fall into it and not be torn to pieces. But the person would never be seen from again. Black holes are \u201clike the walls of a prison. Once you cross it, you will never be able to get out and you will never be able to communicate,\u201d Loeb said. The first image is of a black hole in a galaxy called M87 that is about 53 million light years from Earth. One light year is 5.9 trillion miles, or 9.5 trillion kilometers. This black hole is about 6 billion times the mass of our sun. The telescope data was gathered by the Event Horizon Telescope two years ago, but it took so long to complete the image because it was a massive undertaking, involving about 200 scientists, supercomputers and hundreds of terabytes of data delivered worldwide by plane. The team looked at two supermassive black holes, the M87 and the one at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. The one in our galaxy is closer but much smaller, so they both look the same size in the sky. But the more distant one was easier to take pictures of because it rotates more slowly. \u201cWe've been hunting this for a long time,\u201d Dempsey said. \u201cWe've been getting closer and closer with better technology.\u201d "}}
