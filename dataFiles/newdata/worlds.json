The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping United States experts from entering the country to help.\n\u201cIt was heartbreaking to watch,\u201d said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between 2007 and 2011. \n\u201cIf someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.\u201d\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicentre of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.\nAs an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the US and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the programme after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to US and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\nQuick left amid a bitter US trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the US Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The US CDC said it first learned of a \u201ccluster of 27 cases of pneumonia\u201d of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on December 31.\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as Covid-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems in some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the US and elsewhere.\nDuring a press briefing on Sunday shortly after this story was first published, President Donald Trump dismissed the Reuters report as similar to other stories regarding the CDC that he described as \u201c100 per cent wrong,\u201d without addressing whether the role had been eliminated.\nUS CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield maintained the agency\u2019s presence in China \u201cis actually being augmented as we speak\", without elaborating.\nIn a statement to Reuters before the report was published, the CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington\u2019s ability to get information and \u201chad absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier\".\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser \u201cstarted well before last summer and was due to China\u2019s excellent technical capability and maturity of the programme\".\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as \u201cmentors\u201d to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors\u2019 specific role or expertise.\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country \u201chas adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organisation) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.\u201d\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the US resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government\u2019s suppression of information.\n\u201cIn the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn\u2019t have made a big difference,\u201d Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. \u201cThe problemme was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn\u2019t.\u201d\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield\u2019s conversations with \u201cChinese colleagues\".\nRedfield learned that \u201cthis looks to be a novel coronavirus\u201d from Dr Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cDr Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,\u201d the official said.\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\nZhu and other sources said US leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until January 20.\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the US had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\nAzar told CNN on February 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on January 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n\u201cDr Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th \u2014 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,\u201d Azar said. \u201cWe made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?\u201d\nDays later, the WHO secured permission to send a team that included two US experts. The team visited between February 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.\nOn February 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its \u201ccensorship\u201d of medical professionals and media.\nRelations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the \u201cChinese virus\u201d \u2014 a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatising. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three US news organisations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\nThe decision to eliminate Quick\u2019s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of US staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n\u201cWe had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,\u201d the same expert said.\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move. \u201cIt was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability\u201d it said.\nThe US CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. Covid-19 is not influenza, though it can cause severe respiratory illness.\nThe CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at US Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China\u2019s disease control agency, the sources said.\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people.\nNevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materialises.\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the US resident adviser had still been in China, \u201cit is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.\u201d\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident adviser between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among US health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training programme.\nYet since the training programme was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n\u201cWe go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,\u201d Conway said.\nIn 2007, Dr Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist and one of the longest-serving US officials in the adviser\u2019s position, received China\u2019s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China\u2019s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n\u201cThe message from the administration was, \u2018Don\u2019t work with China, they\u2019re our rival',\u201d Frieden said.\nTrump\u2019s re-election campaign sent out a statement on Sunday evening dismissing controversy about the CDC\u2019S cut as a matter of politics.\n\u201cDemocrats are eager to politicise the coronavirus crisis and weaponise it against President Trump,\" the statement said. \u201cIn so doing, they\u2019re siding with the Chinese and providing cover for Beijing\u2019s cover-up.\u201d"},"1":{"tilte":"UK calls in army, warns people to stay home or face lockdown\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1543149\/uk-calls-in-army-warns-people-to-stay-home-or-face-lockdown","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/03\/5e78aa1f73d39.jpg","discription":"\nBritain sent in the army to deliver protective equipment to hospitals on Monday and told people to stay at home and heed warnings over social distancing or the government would bring in more extreme measures to stop the coronavirus spread.\nWith some doctors saying they felt like \u201ccannon fodder\u201d, the government said the military would help ship millions of items of personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks to healthcare workers who have complained of shortages.\nSo far, 281 Britons have died from the coronavirus and, in the last few days, British authorities have rapidly stepped up action to try to limit the spread of the disease and prevent a repeat of the death toll seen in other countries where thousands have died.\nHowever, there have been complaints from frontline medical staff about shortages of kit, saying they did not feel safe at work.

So, is the coronavirus disease any different?\nReports of the relapse in Japan were not the first as cases had earlier been reported in China. However, the authorities had later clarified that they were due to discrepancies in testing and the patients had not contracted the virus again. \nSince then, scientists across the globe have been trying to figure out whether relapse was a possibility, especially considering some countries \u2014 United Kingdom and Netherlands most prominently \u2014 had chosen to take the \u2018herd immunity\u2019 route, which relies on letting a large part of population contract the virus with the expectation that it would strengthen immunity against it. \nWhile experts are struggling to figure out what happened in the case of the Japanese woman, a study in China has revealed that re-exposure to the virus among monkeys who recovered from it once did not result in them contracting the virus for the second time. The study, however, needs to be taken with a pinch of salt as research on the virus is still ongoing and conclusions are yet to be reached.\nMeanwhile, experts are predicting that it is unlikely that a person who has recovered will contract the virus again. \n\u201cIt is very likely, based on other viral infections, that yes, once a person has had the infection they will generally be immune and won\u2019t get it again. There will always be the odd exception, but that is certainly a reasonable expectation,\u201d Prof Jon Cohen, emeritus professor of infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, told The Guardian.\n\u201cFor the most part, the feeling is once you\u2019ve had a specific coronavirus, you are immune. We don\u2019t have enough data to say that with this coronavirus, but it is likely,\u201d Dr Stephen Gluckman, an infectious diseases physician at Penn Medicine told The Huffington Post. \nThese views are in line with the expectations of United States\u2019 Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which said that the virus was dangerous right now because \u201cthere\u2019s essentially no immunity against this virus in the population because it\u2019s a new virus\u201d.\nIn short, experts are unsure whether the possibilities of reinfections exist among Covid-19 patients but the majority opinion is that people will eventually develop immunity and it is only in rare cases that the virus will attack again. \nWhile little else is known about the virus, what has been established so far after more than 330,000 cases across the globe, is that it affects different people differently. Some face minor, or no symptoms at all, while others are severely impacted with lung infections and respiratory problems. \nIn many cases, symptoms also take some time in appearing after a person has contracted the virus. A study on Chinese patients showed an inverse relationship between time spent after contracting Covid-19 and lung function, meaning that once it starts affecting the lungs, it continues to cause greater damage until it goes away.\nScientists are also not exactly sure about how much time it takes for a patient to recover but the consensus is that it takes up to 14 days after symptoms begin showing for a patient to recover. In most cases \u2014 around 80 per cent \u2014 patients recover after showing symptoms such as fever and not much damage to overall body functions takes place. \nThese are categorised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as mild cases and in these cases. \n \nData from China is now showing that the recovery rates and processes for men and women differ although they are equally likely to contract the disease. \nChinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that while 2.8 pc of men who contracted the virus died, only 1.7pc of women did, CNN reported. \nMeanwhile, in South Korea where 61 percent of confirmed infections have been in women, 54 percent of fatalities were made up of men, according to The Washington Post. \nScientists say there could be a number of factors contributing to why men may be more vulnerable, including women having a stronger immune response to viral infections, particularly of the respiratory tract. \nThe group most at risk are the elderly, around a 15pc of whom died because of the virus, followed by those who had cardiovascular disease, diabetes or respiratory diseases. \nWhile most of the mild cases require no treatment, severe cases require supplemental oxygen and for critical patients intensive care and ventilators may be required. \nMild cases take 7-12 for full recovery, but it could take upwards of two weeks for critical patients to fully recover. It is only after two tests taken 24-hours apart that doctors can be confident of a full recovery and discharge patients, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says.  \nWhile over 96pc of those who were tested positive for Covid-19 in China recovered, scientists are now reporting that some patients could suffer from reduced lung function even after \u201cfull\u201d recovery. Dr Owen Tsang Tak-yin, medical director of the Hong Kong\u2019s Hospital Authority\u2019s Infectious Disease Centre, said two to three of the 12 recover patients were \u201cunable to do things as they had in the past,\" South China Morning Post reported. \n\u201cSome patients might have around a drop of 20 to 30 per cent in lung function,\u201d Dr Tak-yin added.\nRead an account of Chris Gough, an anaesthetist from Oxord, United Kingdom who made a full recovery in 10 days:\n \nResearch by Ebad Pasha "},"11":{"tilte":"Stay indoors, we'll provide the entertainment, says Riz Ahmed\n","link":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1542872\/stay-indoors-well-provide-the-entertainment-says-riz-ahmed","img":"https:\/\/i.dawn.com\/medium\/2020\/03\/5e771cecac426.jpg","discription":"\nWith Covid-19 spreading fast and proving lethal, many across the globe have self-quarantined to not only stay safe but to stop the virus from spreading any further.\nDozens of artists have canceled their tours but are still doing what they do best; provide entertainment.

We hope that after the peace agreement in Doha on 29 February 2020 all sides will move towards intra-Afghan negotiations to establish long-lasting peace in Afghanistan,\u201d Ms Farooqui said.\nThe intra-Afghan talks were scheduled to commence on March 10, but differences between the Afghan government and Taliban over prisoners\u2019 swap agreed under the Doha Accord have blocked further progress.\nUnder the agreement, the Afghan government was to set free 5000 Taliban prisoners and insurgents were to release 1000 captives, but no prisoners have been released so far.\nThe Afghan government, which was not part of US-Taliban negotiations that led to the agreement, conditionally agreed to release 1500 Taliban prisoners in batches, but Taliban refused to accept Kabul\u2019s plan. This difference has led to impasse in the implementation of the peace plan.\nThe situation has been further complicated by the political crisis in Afghanistan because of the controversy over presidential elections.\nPublished in Dawn, March 20th, 2020"}}
