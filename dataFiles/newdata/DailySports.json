The acquisitions of Leonard Floyd and A\u2019Shawn Robinson had better not be the last on this side of the ball. \n\nThe offense that relied on Gurley to produce league-leading yards from scrimmage and set up the passing game in the 2018 Super Bowl season is looking for a new featured back. At least there\u2019s good news on offense: Jared Goff and the offensive line won\u2019t be the targets of so much griping from fans, at least until after the team\u2019s new crises are solved. \n\nHere\u2019s a look, unit by unit, at where the Rams\u2019 problems are \u2013 and aren\u2019t \u2013 a short 25 weeks before the scheduled first Sunday of the 2020 season: \n\n Of team-leading tackler \nSigning former Bears first-round pick Floyd was a start on the edge; he was coached in Chicago by new Rams defensive coordinator Brandon Staley. In the middle, nobody on the current Rams roster is perfect to step in, although Troy Reeder had a good rookie year and might remember that Littleton was an undrafted free agent himself once. \n\n \nStill a solid line because Aaron Donald and a trash can would be a solid line, but it took a step back. \n\nIt\u2019s deep enough to withstand the losses. But cutting Robey-Coleman leaves an opening at slot cornerback, Christian\u2019s departure as a free agent takes away a valuable backup at safety and\u00a0Weddle\u2019s retirement in February takes away veteran leadership. \n\nThe basic foursome remains strong: corners Jalen Ramsey, a three-time Pro Bowl pick, and Troy Hill, the third-hardest NFL corner to complete a pass against last season (45.6% of targets), and safeties John Johnson, returning from a shoulder injury, and Taylor Rapp, the Rams\u2019 best rookie in 2019. \n\n After \nIt would take an epic trade or draft-day genius to replace what Gurley gave the Rams at his best. More likely, whoever the Rams get, new offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell also needs 2019 backups Darrell Henderson and Malcolm Brown to do more. \n\nThe \nThe unanswered question is who will back up Goff. Blake Bortles is a free agent and was reportedly fielding other offers but considering staying in L.A. \n\nNo changes. It remains possible the Rams will trade Brandin Cooks and the rest of his big contract. The team feels Cooks\u2019 value goes beyond his waning statistics, though. The threat of his speed opens up those short passes that Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods turn into big gains. \n\nNo changes. This was a Rams strength down the stretch with Tyler Higbee taking over from Gerald Everett as a pass-catcher and Higbee\u2019s and Johnny Mundt\u2019s blocking helping to rescue the offensive line. But no team ever opened \nKicker Greg Zuerlein remains a free agent. \n\nGiven the Rams\u2019 salary-cap pressure this offseason, it\u2019s no shock that they took an initial step back. But did they take a step back into a pit of quicksand? \n\nThey and the Patriots are the only teams to lose three players generally rated among the top 50 free agents this offseason, without signing any. The Patriots\u2019 losses include Tom Brady. \n\nThird in the NFC West at 9-7 and out of the playoffs last season, the Rams saw the division get tougher this week when the fourth-place Cardinals traded for wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins. \n\nIn Las Vegas, bettors raised \nThat\u2019s now, the Rams would say. \n\n\u201cEach year, your players change, your team changes. We knew going into this season, there would be tough choices,\u201d Demoff said this week. \u201c(Coach) Sean (McVay) and Les have put together an unbelievable track record of growing players, of finding ways to be competitive and field winning teams that challenge for the playoffs. I don\u2019t think this year will be any different.\u201d \n\nHe added: \u201cI think the core of our team, with Jared and Aaron and Jalen and the receivers and everybody returning, is exciting. But it\u2019s going to be a different looking team than the one that left the field in 2019. But again, I think everybody knew that was going to be the case.\u201d \n\nIf everybody didn\u2019t, everybody does now. \n\n LB Leonard Floyd (signed as free agent), DT A\u2019Shawn Robinson (signed as free agent) \n\n RB Todd Gurley (released), LB Clay Matthews (released), LB Dante Fowler (signed with Falcons), LB Cory Littleton (signed with Raiders), DL Michael Brockers (signed with Ravens), S Marqui Christian (signed with Jets), CB Nickell Robey-Coleman (option not exercised) \n  \n\t\t\t"},"2":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tChargers free-agency analysis: No Tom Brady, no problem\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/21\/chargers-free-agency-analysis-no-tom-brady-no-problem\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/LDN-L-CHARGERS-0923-850-SV-1-1.jpg?w=482","discription":"\nThe Chargers shot their shot and quickly moved on after being denied by Tom Brady. \n\nCan\u2019t fault them for trying. Brady would have been the Chargers\u2019 marquee attraction for their first season playing at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. But landing Brady would have meant more than just selling tickets. Brady\u2019s arrival would have been Super Bowl or bust. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Chargers, however, won\u2019t have that pressure of trying to deliver a championship in 2020. That belongs to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who signed Brady to a two-year, $50 million deal Friday. \n\nBut the Chargers are missing a headliner to fill 70,000 seats at the new stadium, and don\u2019t even have their familiar star players. Quarterback Philip Rivers is with the Indianapolis Colts and running back Melvin Gordon now plays for the Denver Broncos. \nSo the best way to attract attention regardless of who\u2019s on the roster is to win games. Once Brady turned down the Chargers, they quickly commenced Plan B. They had money to spend, but they didn\u2019t make desperate moves. They stuck to the fallback plan. It was Brady or Tyrod Taylor, paired with a to-be-determined rookie quarterback. The Chargers have the No. 6 overall pick in next month\u2019s draft. \n\nQuarterbacks such as Cam Newton (via trade) and Jameis Winston are available, and would certainly attract more attention than Taylor, but the Chargers don\u2019t seem willing to mortgage their future just to sell tickets in 2020. Chasing Brady was worth the risk because they knew he would either retire in two seasons or move on to his next team while a rookie QB develops on the sidelines. \n\nIf the Chargers went after Newton, he likely would have wanted a lucrative contract extension. Winston probably wasn\u2019t considered because of his turnover issues. With Taylor, he\u2019s a proven winner who doesn\u2019t turn the ball over, although he\u2019s been criticized for playing it too safe at times. Most importantly, he\u2019s already signed at a low cost for 2020. Taylor has one year left on his contract with a base salary of $5 million. \n\nThe rumors about Newton being an option for the Chargers quickly vanished. Reports emerged Wednesday that they\u2019re moving forward with Taylor as the starting quarterback. \n\nThe Chargers charged forward and spent big, but wisely. Here\u2019s a review of what the Chargers have done in the past week during the free-agency frenzy: \nTrai Turner is already planning for him and Bryan Bulaga to pave the way for many touchdowns to be scored on the right side of the field. \n\nTurner said in a conference call this week he hasn\u2019t been told about a possible position change. He expects to remain at right guard, and why would the Chargers move him? He was named to five consecutive Pro Bowls at right guard with the Carolina Panthers before being traded to the Chargers for left tackle Russell Okung. \n\nBulaga, who agreed to a three-year, $30 million deal from the Chargers, spent the majority of his 10-year career starting at right tackle for the Green Bay Packers. He was viewed as one of the top free-agent offensive tackles. \n\nAs of now, the Chargers don\u2019t plan on moving Turner and Bulaga, giving them one of the best right sides to an offensive line in the NFL. The duo would replace last year\u2019s starters Sam Tevi, a right tackle, and Michael Schofield, a free-agent right guard. \n\nBut the Chargers still have plenty of uncertainty at the other three offensive-line positions. \n\nCenter Mike Pouncey hadn\u2019t been cleared from his neck injury as of last month, but he was optimistic about continuing his career when he spoke to reporters in December. Left guards Dan Feeney and Forrest Lamp have been inconsistent the past three seasons. Lamp has rarely been on the field because of injuries. Feeney proved to be a reliable starter when he was in between Okung and Pouncey. \n\nChargers coach Anthony Lynn called Feeney an excellent center last month, so the 2017 third-round pick could be a top candidate to replace Pouncey if he\u2019s not cleared to play. In that scenario, the Chargers would likely take their chances with Lamp staying healthy at left guard. The 2017 second-round pick has one year left on his contract. \n\nSecond-year offensive lineman Trey Pipkins would likely replace Okung at left tackle if the Chargers don\u2019t add a veteran or draft one. But the Chargers are likely set on using their first-round pick on a quarterback, and starting a rookie left tackle from the later rounds would be risky. Veteran left tackle Jason Peters is available, but he\u2019s 38 years old and has dealt with injuries the past few seasons. \n\nThe addition of four-time Pro Bowl cornerback Chris Harris Jr. was a surprise, but a good one for the Chargers. Harris spent nine seasons with the Denver Broncos before agreeing to a two-year, $20.25 million deal from the Chargers. \n\nOn paper, the Chargers have one of the best secondaries in the NFL, with Harris joining strong safety Derwin James and cornerbacks Casey Hayward and Desmond King. \n\nAdding Harris might cause some shuffling. Harris is regarded as a top slot cornerback, a position that currently belongs to King, an All-Pro defensive back in 2018. But King had a down 2019 season, and with Adrian Phillips heading to the New England Patriots, he could move into the versatile safety role. \n\nHarris, however, recently told the NFL Network he\u2019s excited about playing on the outside again and being moved around on the field. Perhaps King and Harris will alternate at slot corner. It doesn\u2019t hurt to have versatile defensive backs, but this is a make-or-break season for King, who has one year left on his rookie deal. He\u2019ll need to return to his All-Pro ways if he wants to break the bank next offseason. \n\nIt was puzzling that the Chargers, with pass rushers Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram, didn\u2019t generate more than 30 sacks last season. \n\nBut the Chargers struggled to create interior pressure. Veteran nose tackle Brandon Mebane, who was released, wasn\u2019t the same player he once was, defensive tackle Justin Jones had a strong start to 2019 before sustaining injuries, and rookie defensive tackle Jerry Tillery never found a rhythm. \n\nThe team addressed the need by adding two-time Pro Bowl nose tackle Linval Joseph, who agreed to a two-year, $17 million deal. Joseph, 31, was released by the Minnesota Vikings, but it was likely more about cap-space reasons than on-field production. Joseph is viewed as a nose tackle who creates a pass rush and defends the run. \n\nAdding Joseph will give the Chargers\u2019 defensive line a boost, and they\u2019ll be better in blitzing situations if James stays healthy. \n\nThe Chargers said goodbye to linebackers Thomas Davis and Jatavis Brown, but they\u2019re not thin at the position with Drue Tranquill, Denzel Perryman, Uchenna Nwosu (more of an edge rusher) and Kyzir White. But the Chargers were missing athletic playmakers at the position last season. \n\nThe Chargers have plenty of athleticism at running back with Austin Ekeler and Justin Jackson, but are missing the power element with Gordon going to Denver and fullback Derek Watt heading to the Pittsburgh Steelers. They\u2019re in need of a bruising back for short-yardage situations. \n\nWhoever is the Chargers\u2019 starting quarterback \u2013 Taylor or a rookie \u2013 will have plenty of weapons with Ekeler, tight end Hunter Henry and wide receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, but they\u2019re missing a third wideout. The team auditioned Travis Benjamin, who was released, Andre Patton and Jason Moore, but never found their Tyrell Williams replacement, the former Chargers\u2019 wide receiver who joined the Raiders last offseason. \n\nBut searching for a linebacker, running back and wide receiver can be addressed in the NFL draft, along with their biggest needs (quarterback and left tackle). \n\nThe Chargers can be called winners after one-week of free agency despite the rejection from Brady. They had two plans and stuck to them, and perhaps the second one was the better of the two. \n\nThe Chargers had more money to spend after Brady said yes to Tampa Bay. If Brady was L.A. bound, maybe only Bulaga joins him. Without the 42-year-old quarterback, the Chargers were able to pay Bulaga, Joseph, Harris and still have money left over to spend. \n\nThe Chargers\u2019 Plan B deserves at least a B grade. If they\u2019re able to land Alabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa in next month\u2019s draft, that offseason grade might jump to a perfect score. \n\nRT Bryan Bulaga (signed as free agent), NT\u00a0Linval Joseph (signed as free agent), CB\u00a0Chris Harris Jr. (signed as free agent), RG\u00a0Trai Turner (trade) \n\nQB Philip Rivers (signed with Colts), RB Melvin Gordon (signed with Broncos), S Adrian Phillips (signed with Patriots), FB\u00a0Derek Watt (signed with Steelers), DB\u00a0Jaylen Watkins (signed with Texans), LB\u00a0Thomas Davis (released), LT\u00a0Russell Okung (trade), NT Brandon Mebane (released), LB\u00a0Jatavis Brown (signed with Eagles), WR\u00a0Travis Benjamin (released) \n\nA message from the man himself: \n\u2014 Indianapolis Colts (@Colts) \n\n\nLinval Joseph: the kinda guy we could use right now \ud83d\ude0f \n\u2014 Los Angeles Chargers (@Chargers) \n\n\nBryan Bulaga, Iowa \n\u2014 Los Angeles Chargers (@Chargers) \n\n"},"3":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tWhicker: UCLA\u2019s Zach Pettway and other baseball stars of tomorrow try to see beyond the void\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/20\/whicker-uclas-zach-pettway-and-other-baseball-stars-of-tomorrow-try-to-see-beyond-the-void\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Pettway-Zach-UCLA-1-1.jpg?w=620","discription":"\nThe Millville Thunderbolts didn\u2019t play baseball Friday \n\nThey had a scrimmage planned against Williamstown. Next Monday they are penciled in for another scrimmage against Washington Township, and then against Pennsville Memorial on Wednesday. April 1 is the scheduled Opening Day, against Holy Spirit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAll are redacted. New Jersey schools are closed. \n\nUnder these conditions, Mike Trout would not have played a high school inning in 2009. He had been a Team USA player, and people knew him, but he still lasted until the 25th pick of the first round of that draft. \nNow the major leagues have been paralyzed until who knows when. But so has the machinery of player procurement. \n\nThe NCAA canceled the College World Series. Nobody is playing college baseball. There is no alternate league, no barnstorming circuit. \n\nScouts are immobilized. Scouting directors keep going over the same small samples, gathered from fall ball, or the four weekends when the colleges were operational. \n\nMatt Swanson, the Angels\u2019 scouting director, made his first pick in 2017. It was Jo Adell, the \n\u201cThis year? He wouldn\u2019t have played,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t started their season yet. We had done a lot of work on him, but he wouldn\u2019t have had a high school season. We\u2019re just going to try to do as good a job as we can with what we have.\u201d \nWill Smith was the \n\u201cThen he got into his ACC season and he just kept hitting,\u201d recalled Marty Lamb, the Dodgers\u2019 area scout. Smith never stopped until he was picked 32nd overall by the Dodgers, and he enters 2020, at some point, as their lead catcher. \n\nAll scouts yearn to find that player who lives under the radar. What happens when there\u2019s no radar? \n\nIn Long Beach, Zach Pettway goes to the backyard and throws baseballs at a net. The net doesn\u2019t hit back but, then, neither has anyone else. \n\nAs UCLA started 13-2, Pettway went 3-0. In his wins over Oklahoma State and Vanderbilt, he gave up five hits in 15 innings. In 25-2\/3 innings, Pettway struck out 29 and walked one, and the opposing batting average was .141. \n\nAnd there it will stand, apparently. Zach, a junior, works out with his brother Ryan, who pitches at Long Beach Wilson High as Zach did and is also an accomplished quarterback. Otherwise, he battles time. \n\n\u201cIt hurts a lot,\u201d Pettway said, \u201cbut there\u2019s a lot more important stuff going on than just baseball. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s life-altering. I\u2019d say it\u2019s year-altering. \n\n\u201cI was upset when it ended, but I\u2019m just a 21-year-old college student. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t just a flimsy decision. A lot of thought went into it. What hurts is that you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever play with the same guys again. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s coming back or who\u2019s leaving. That\u2019s why it\u2019s tough to see a season like this end.\u201d \n\nCoach John Savage agrees. He isn\u2019t shy about saying that the NCAA made a \u201cknee-jerk\u201d decision. \n\n\u201cI look at Zach, and a guy like Holden Powell, who has 20 strikeouts in nine-2\/3 innings (and eight scoreless appearances),\u201d Savage said. \u201cConsidering how many really good players we lost and how many guys have stepped up, it\u2019s frustrating because I really thought we were playing as well as anybody in the country. And I\u2019m sure a lot of teams felt that way.\u201d \n\nNow Savage\u2019s desk is overflowing with theoretical 2021 rosters, since the NCAA has indicated it might grant current players an extra year of eligibility. That plays havoc with an 11.7 scholarship limit, particularly when the Bruins and everyone else have already recruited. \n\nThe draft was scheduled to coincide with the College World Series in Omaha, beginning June 10. Now the CWS won\u2019t happen and maybe the draft won\u2019t either. That, of course, would cause a massive backlog for the colleges. \n\n\u201cThey have talked about having combines before the draft,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cMy concern there would be the pitchers. If they haven\u2019t thrown and all of a sudden they\u2019re out there throwing for the scouts, the injury risk goes up. Fortunately, our crosscheckers have done their homework on a lot of guys. There\u2019s a top pitching prospect at Tennessee (Garrett Crochet) who didn\u2019t get to pitch. It\u2019s just strange for everybody.\u201d \n\nMaybe we shouldn\u2019t have been so dissatisfied with the Old Normal. \n"},"4":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tAlexander: With coronavirus putting sports on hold, how are we coping?\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/22\/alexander-with-sports-on-hold-how-are-we-coping\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/imageedit_4_8620754631-1.jpg?w=595","discription":"\nIt has been two weeks since the BNP Paribas tennis extravaganza in Indian Wells was canceled, and it\u2019s been a week and a half since the rest of the world of sports essentially shut down. \n\nDoesn\u2019t it feel like a couple of months? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nYou know the saying about how life comes at you fast? It has come at us in big, crashing waves in just two weeks. We went from a state of relative normalcy, albeit one where we worried about germs and hand washing and crowded venues and handshakes, to hauntingly quiet isolation (or at least a 6-foot buffer zone). \n\nSports, in this case, was the forerunner of our locked-down society. Seasons were postponed. March Madness was canceled. School sports\u2019 springtime seasons have been scrubbed.\u00a0 Sportscasts have been reduced to looking for highlights from the past, and sports channels are filling time with old \u2013 OK, classic \u2013 games from their archives. Leagues wonder when it will be safe to resume and how much of their schedules can be accommodated. \nThe worst part? The future is still so uncertain. Nobody really knows how bad this will be, or how long it will linger. And a method we historically have used to cope with tough times \u2013 losing ourselves in the games and doing so with fellow members of our communities \u2013 is no longer available. \n\n\u201cObviously, there are a lot of people who are anxious, rightfully so, about what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Christian End, a sociology professor at Cincinnati\u2019s Xavier University. \u201cSports might have served as a way to maybe just give them a release for a couple of hours a day or whatever it might be. \n\n\u201c\u2026 Sports gave you some sort of excitement from just doing your normal routine. And I think right now a lot of things are going to be routine and (will) become self-contained. Sports, in a way, could have been a means to help people break out of that.\u201d \n\nThere are small pockets of normalcy. The NFL free agency frenzy last week provided a release of sorts, allowing fans to banter, argue and speculate. After all, the NFL hasn\u2019t canceled a game yet. \n\n(Technically, it hasn\u2019t scheduled any yet, either.) \nYou can still bet on horse racing, which has become the equivalent of a studio show anyway because of off-track betting. But that\u2019s it. \n\nOtherwise, for those who care about the games and the teams \u2013 and, admittedly, for those of us who make a living either in the sports industry itself or as part of the media covering it \u2013 the prospect is of a long dry spell with no end in sight. We had hoped seasons could begin\/resume in April. Now we hope it might be May, but we have to steel ourselves for the possibility that the games might not start again until June, July or even later. \n\nThe absence of fellowship around the games is just as keenly felt. Fantasy sports are popular in large part because they give people something to talk about. Beyond that, games bring families and friends together. \n\nEnd, in our phone conversation a few days ago, recalled growing up in Wisconsin and having autumn Sunday afternoons become family time centered around one particular ritual. \n\n\u201cWe knew wherever we were, whatever we had going on, from 12 to 3 we were going to be at Mom and Dad\u2019s watching the (Packers) game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt fulfills some of those family needs.\u201d \n\nNow, he said, the longtime buddies who make up his fantasy football league have talked about doing a weekly FaceTime or Zoom group call just to maintain those bonds, or even creating a video game league of their own. \n\n\u201cPeople often refer to it as a social lubricant, and it is,\u201d he said. \u201cI can sit there and talk to you about the game and should the Bengals trade Andy Dalton and whatever it might be. And we can agree to disagree, but we\u2019re not going to come to blows, whereas if we start talking politics or something, then we may be equally as knowledgeable about it but it seems like there\u2019s greater potential for conflict. \n\n\u201cI think it is going to be interesting to see how that plays out. But I do think \u2026 another consequence is that people will say, \u2018Well, why the heck have I been so worried about sports over time. This has been occupying my time. I\u2019ve been wasting money doing it. I\u2019m done with it.\u2019 Kind of like what people experience when leagues go on strike and they sort of realize, \u2018You know, it was nice doing something constructive with my Sunday instead of spending seven hours in front of three NFL games or whatever it might be.\u201d \n\nOf that, I\u2019m not so sure. People \nSo how do we cope? \n\nSports video games might satisfy those cravings in ways we hadn\u2019t anticipated. NASCAR and IndyCar both ran simulations of their scheduled weekend events this weekend. NASCAR\u2019s iRacing was aired on FS1, replacing what would have been the real race, and NASCAR public relations and individual teams were sending out press releases during the week as if their drivers were racing for real rather than in simulators. \n\n(The \u201crace\u201d itself turned out to be a fun finish, sort of weird but competitive, with Denny Hamlin nudging Dale Earnhardt Jr. out of the way to cross the finish line first.) \n\nMeanwhile, the \nThe Kings, likewise, are using the Twitch platform for their own virtual games, including one Sunday night against the Coyotes.

Hart Union School District \u2013 like so many throughout the nation and beyond \u2013 announced it was closing its schools and curtailing extracurricular activities. \n\nFor Saugus students \u2013 who have begun engaging in \u201cdistance learning\u201d online, apart from one another as an existential crisis envelopes the world around them \u2013 their campus\u2019 closure began March 16 and was scheduled to last for at least three weeks. On Friday, word came that the closure will last until at least May 4. \n\nThe district also previously announced cancellations of sports activities until April 30 \u2013 a week before the CIF playoffs were set to begin, which in effect scrapped the spring sports calendar. \nThen, on Tuesday, March 17, Gov. Gavin Newsom made even those projections seem conservative when he warned that most of the state\u2019s \n\u201cTo think I just walked out of school on Friday last week and that was the last time possibly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for that,\u201d said Tyler Nilson, a senior middle-distance and distance runner whose plans to pursue medicine in college are stoking a keen interest in monitoring the coronavirus outbreak. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult,\u201d said Mackenzie Plasschaert, a senior whose competitive cheer competition calendar was wiped out. \u201cKnowing it could\u2019ve been over before I knew it.\u201d \n\nWhen the decision came down \u2013 just a few days after a bomb threat caused a campus lockdown that \u201cbrought back those traumatic memories,\u201d senior Timothy Angelo said \u2013 members of the track and field team were worried whether their meet at Canyon High and the next day\u2019s invitational at Redondo Union High might be canceled. But they thought they might be rained out, not that those meets, and then all the rest, would be canceled because of the pandemic. \n\nDistance runner Tyler Lentz was on campus when he got the news. \n\n\u201cI tried to focus on class, but all I could think about was track,\u201d said Lentz, who was thrilled to finally be healthy this season after battling injuries for the past two years. \u201cI\u2019d been envisioning in my mind how I was gonna race, the times I was going to get \u2013 and all of a sudden, to be told you can\u2019t do that, it was a shock. I was still thinking, \u2018Is this a prank?\u2019 in the back of my mind. Obviously, I knew it was real, but it was hard for me to focus that day. My mind was just on running.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt was just very surreal,\u201d said Hailey Rutter, who\u2019d hoped setting new personal records on the track would help fortify her scholarship at Sacramento State. \u201cJust crazy.\u201d \n\nSanta Clarita Valley\u2019s Hart School District cancels athletics until April 30, essentially ending all spring athletics for Foothill League schools. \n\nAlso, some reaction from SCV baseball players.  \n\u2014 Tarek Fattal (@Tarek_Fattal) \n\n\nMauricio Guardado, a senior catcher on the baseball team, said he was doing some extra hitting at home in his garage when he got word his season was over: \u201cI couldn\u2019t finish getting work in, I was so sick to my stomach,\u201d he said. \n\nAnd then came the text messages and phone calls: \u201cTo have the younger guys reach out to you,\u201d Guardado said, \u201cand tell you how blessed they were to play with you, it really hit home.\u201d \n\nThe softball team gathered for an emotional meeting with their coach, Julie Archer, who confirmed all the social media rumors, giving stark credence to the familiar cliche: \nIt all made the softball team\u2019s 7-6 loss on an international tiebreaker, in likely its final game March 7, sting so much more, shortstop Libbie McMahan said. \n\n\u201cIf that is my last game, it\u2019s a disappointment,\u201d said McMahan, who\u2019s finished a 750-piece puzzle since she\u2019s been trapped inside, social distancing and missing her teammates badly. \u201cI\u2019m praying we get to play again.\u201d \n\nMembers of the track team are hoping against hope, too, and continuing to train on their own, either individually or in groups of three or fewer. \u201cIt helps our sanity,\u201d said Sanchez, whose previously overflowing plate, which included school, track and her job at Petco \u2013 yes, shoppers have been buying a lot of pet food \u2013 now feels practically empty. \n\n\u201cRegardless of how people will be prepared, mentally or physically, for another meet, it would be a really, really meaningful moment for everyone,\u201d Nilson said. \u201cTo get to say goodbye to that four-year period of our life that\u2019s taken up so much time and so much of our hearts.\u201d \n\nIt isn\u2019t only sports these seniors will miss. They\u2019ve been told prom is off, and a graduation ceremony feels tenuous. \n\nThose traditions were all the more meaningful considering what a \u201cride and a half\u201d this fractured school year has endured, Hayden Trowbridge said. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult year, and we\u2019ve already had to compromise a lot of things,\u201d Nilson said. \u201cTo have to compromise even more of that now, we\u2019ve given up a lot of our high school experience. I want prom, and graduation and grad night and that last week of school, to be able to say goodbye and sign yearbooks and go through all those senior rituals. \n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find ways to make due and come up with our own makeshift rituals.\u201d \n\nThey\u2019ll get through it. They know they can. If anything, that\u2019s what this difficult year taught this 2020 Centurions class. \n\n\u201cI want people to understand that in no way, shape or form are we trying to trying to use whatever has happened at Saugus \u2013 with the shooting and the coronavirus \u2013 to victimize ourselves,\u201d said Trowbridge, one of only two seniors on the baseball team who\u2019d had the chance to play varsity ball before this season. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing it as something happening to us, but something happening for us \u2013 life lessons that will help us become better people, better humans,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have had a really tough year, but this isn\u2019t the worst year of my life. I\u2019ve had opportunities to connect with people, of having real, authentic, genuine human relationships. \n\n\u201cWe, as teenagers, have been introduced to the unfortunate circumstances of life way before we were supposed to be, but regardless, we\u2019re persevering as a community.

With travel and other restrictions this becomes an untenable situation,\u201d AOC chief executive Matt Carroll said in a statement. \u201cThe IOC had adopted the key principles of putting athlete health first and ensuring it acted in their best interests and the interests of sport. This decision reflects those principles. \n\n\u201cWe are now in a position where we can plan with greater certainty.\u201d \n\nNational Olympic committee officials for several Asian counties Monday morning (Asian time, Sunday evening the U.S.) began pushing IOC and Japanese officials hard to postpone the Games to 2021, according to a person familiar with the discussions. \n\nA number of Asian NOC officials have privately expressed concerns about proceeding with the Games as scheduled with the possibility of the World Health Organization not designating several global regions, including Japan, clear of the virus until well after the Games\u2019 scheduled dates, according to the person. \n\nIn addition to Australia, the NOCs in several Asian countries held conference calls Monday (Asian time) about postponing the Games with top officials for those NOCs already expressing skepticism and concern about holding the Tokyo Olympics this summer, the SCNG has learned. Some Olympic officials privately questioned whether some airline carriers would even be permitted by their governments to travel to Japan in July. \n\nInternational sports federations received an urgent message from the IOC over the weekend to check in immediately with their sport\u2019s IOC coordinator as the organization examines qualifying and competition schedules under the three postponement options, the SCNG has also learned. \n\nInternational sports federations plans to deal with remaining qualifying issues for the Tokyo Games are due to be filed with the IOC this week. Qualification has yet to be completed for 47 percent of all athlete spots for the Olympics. Safety concerns and restrictions in some countries have not only called into question whether \u00a0qualification will resume but also prevented or limited athletes training for the Games. \n\nThe Norwegian and Brazilian Olympic committee over the weekend joined leading international health experts, track and field\u2019s governing bodies in the U.S. and Great Britain, as well as USA Swimming and a growing list of Olympic champions and likely Olympians in calling for the IOC to postpone the Games, which are scheduled to open July 24 and run through August 9. The Paralympics are scheduled for August 25-September 6. \n\n\u201cThis crisis is bigger than even the Olympics,\u201d \u00a0Hayley Wickenheiser, an IOC member from Canada and four-time Olympic gold medalist in ice hockey, said on Twitter. Wickenheiser competed in six Olympics\u2014five in hockey, one in softball\u2014and is currently attending the University of Calgary medical school. \n\n\u201cAthletes can\u2019t train. Attendees can\u2019t travel plan. Sponsors and marketers can\u2019t market with a degree of sensitivity. \n\n\u201cI think the IOC insisting this will move ahead, with such conviction, is insensitive and irresponsible given the state of humanity.\u201d \n\nThe likelihood of the Games being delayed gained further momentum later Sunday when World Athletics, track and field\u2019s worldwide governing body and the Olympic movement\u2019s most influential international federation, said it \u201cwelcomes discussions with the IOC to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.\u201d \n\nWorld Athletics said in a statement that it \u201cwrote to the IOC earlier today to relay this feedback from its Area Presidents, Council and athletes. We stand ready to work with the IOC and all sport on an alternative date.\u201d \n\nWorld Athletics president Sebastian Coe, a two-time Olympic 1,500-meter champion, said in a letter to Bach Sunday that holding the Olympics as scheduled \u201cis neither feasible nor desirable.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo one wants to see the Olympic Games postponed but \u2026 we cannot hold the event at all costs, certainly not at the cost of athlete safety,\u201d Coe wrote. \u201cA decision on the Olympic Games may become very obvious very quickly.\u201d \n\nJapan reported 1,055 confirmed COVID-19 cases through Sunday, up 400 from the previous day. That figure does not include 712 confirmed cases on a cruise ship moored last month off the shore of Japan. \n\n\u201cIt would be utterly irresponsible to hold the Olympics. Why? I was an ardent supporter of holding the Brazil Olympics despite Zika, but #COVID19 is a once in a century pandemic,\u201d Georgetown law school professor Lawrence O. Gostin said on Twitter Sunday. Gostin has served on several World Health Organization panels and was a senior advisor to the United Nations Secretary General\u2019s post-Ebola committee. \n\nPostponement would ease concerns of athletes in several countries who have been unable to train because government restrictions related to the virus or worry that they are risking their health but continuing to train in the midst of a pandemic. \n\n\u201cThere is no postponement, no cancellation. But it (the IOC) is putting us at risk,\u201d Katerina Stefanidi, the 2016 Olympic pole vault champion from Greece, said in an interview with Reuters. \n\n\u201cWe all want Tokyo to happen but what is the Plan B if it does not happen? \n\n\u201cKnowing about a possible option has a major effect on my training because I may be taking risks now that I would not take if I knew there was also the possibility of a Plan B.\u201d \n\nIn the wake of such criticism, the IOC\u00a0 executives shifted gears Sunday as they tried head off the latest in a series of scandals and renewed complaints that the organization is tone deaf and continues to prioritize corporate and broadcasting partnerships over athlete safety and concerns. \n\nBach acknowledged the criticism in his letter to athletes Sunday. \n\n\u201cI think I can feel with those among you who consider the situation to be unsatisfactory,\u201d he wrote \n\nThe IOC decision ,reached in an executive board meeting Sunday, to set a deadline for deciding on whether to postpone the Games was a significant shift from only a day earlier. \n\n\u201cThe IOC will, in full coordination and partnership with the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee, the Japanese authorities and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, start detailed discussions to complete\u00a0 its assessment of the rapid development of the worldwide health situation and its impact on the Olympic Games, including the scenario of postponement,\u201d the IOC said in a statement after the executive board meeting Sunday. \u201cThe IOC is confident that it will have finalized these discussions within the next four weeks, and greatly appreciates the solidarity and partnership of the NOCs and IFs in supporting the athletes and adapting Games planning. \n\n\u201cThe IOC (executive board) emphasized that a cancellation of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 would not solve any of the problems or help anybody. Therefore, cancellation is not on the agenda.\u201d \n\nThe IOC\u2019s statement and behind the scenes scrambling came just a day after Bach pushed back against growing pressure to postpone the Games. \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t postpone the Olympic Games like a football match next Saturday,\u201d Bach told a German radio network. \n\nBach, who even before the COVID-19 crisis was frequently criticized for not addressing athlete concerns, reached out to athletes in a letter Sunday. \n\nOpening the letter by saying \u201cin this unprecedented crisis we are all united, Bach acknowledged athlete concerns about also emphasized safety \u201cimprovements\u201d in Japan and the arrival of the Olympic flame in the host country. \u00a0. \n\n\u201cLike you, we are very much concerned about what the COVID-19 pandemic is doing to people\u2019s lives,\u201d Bach wrote. \u201cHuman lives take precedence over everything, including the staging of the Games. The IOC wants to be part of the solution. Therefore we have made it our leading principle to safeguard the health of everyone involved, and to contribute to containing the virus.\u00a0I would like to assure you that we will adhere to this in all our decisions concerning the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. \n\n\u201cWhat we all share, however, is tremendous uncertainty. This uncertainty rocks our nerves and raises or strengthens doubts about a positive future; it destroys hope. Some even have to fear for their very existence. This uncertainty stems from the fact that, at this moment, nobody can really make fully reliable statements about the duration of this fight against the virus. This is true for sport, science, the media, politics, and all of society. Therefore also the IOC can unfortunately not answer all your questions. This is why we are relying on the advice of a Task Force including the World Health Organization (WHO). \n\n\u201cAs successful athletes, you know that we should never give up, even if the chance to succeed appears to be very small. Our commitment to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is based on this experience. It is our experience as athletes that you must always be ready to adapt to new situations. For this reason we have, as indicated before, been thinking in different scenarios and are adapting them almost day by day. \n\n\u201cOn the one hand, there are significant improvements in Japan where the people are warmly welcoming the Olympic flame. This could strengthen our confidence in our Japanese hosts that we could, with certain safety restrictions, organize Olympic Games in the country whilst respecting our principle of safeguarding the health of everyone involved. On the other hand, we have seen a dramatic increase in cases and new outbreaks of the virus in different countries on different continents. This is why we have to undertake the next step in our scenarios.\u201d \n\nU.S. Olympic and Paralympic athletes\u2019 advisory council chairman Han Xiao and Sarah Hirshland, USOPC CEO, said in a statement \u201cThe progress reflected in today\u2019s IOC update to the global community is an important step in providing clarity, but our athlete community continues to face enormous ambiguity surrounding the 2020 Games in Tokyo. \n\nHaving spent countless hours communicating with IOC leadership, our peers around the world, our NGBs and the athletes we serve,\u201d the statement continued \u201cwe know the difficult obstacles ahead and we are all appreciative that the IOC has heard our concerns and needs, and is working to address them as quickly as possible.\u201d \n\nPostponement of the Tokyo Games would mark the sixth time the Olympic Games have not taken place as scheduled. The 1916 Games in Berlin were cancelled because of World War I. Japan was supposed to host both the 1949 Summer (Tokyo) and Winter Olympics (Sapporo) but withdrew as hosts after it invaded China in 1937. \n\nThe 1944 Summer Games in London and Winter Olympics in Cortina d\u2019 Ampezzo were cancelled because of World War II. London hosted the 1948 Summer Olympics. The 1948 Winter Games were held in St. Moritz. \n\nPostponing the Games to 2021 or 2022 would present several scheduling obstacles for the IOC and international federations. The 2021 World Track and Field Championships are scheduled to be held August 6-11 in Eugene. Next year\u2019s World Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan are planned for a similar window\u2013July 16-August 1\u2013to the 2020 Games dates. The 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England are scheduled for a similar window\u2013July 27-August 7. The Commonwealth Games are expected to feature 19 sports and 5,000 athletes from 72 countries. \n\nThe Tokyo Games come with a $12.6 billion price tag, with the costs divided between the organizing committee, Tokyo and federal governments. The Games have attracted a reported $3 billion in domestic sponsorship and marketing deals in addition to NBC\u2019s $1.4 billion broadcasting fee. \n\nWhile postponement will have a significant financial impact on Japan, economists have projected that cancellation would create a $75 billion hit on the Japanese economy. \n\nOrganizers are expecting to host 11,000 athletes and 4,400 para-athletes and have suited an Olympic Village with 3,000 apartments. \n\nDelaying the Tokyo Olympics to 2021 would eliminate questions over whether construction on the new track stadium in Eugene financed by Nike co-founder Phil Knight will be finished by the Olympic Trials (June 19-28)?\u00a0 Oregon\u2019s state high school association said last week the state track meet (May 29-30) was moved from its longtime home on the University of Oregon campus \u201cdue to construction timelines\u201d with the Knight stadium project. \n  \n\t\t\t"},"7":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tHow the Lakers have stayed engaged in the age of coronavirus\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/20\/how-the-lakers-have-stayed-engaged-in-the-age-of-coronavirus\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/basketballs-1.jpg?w=620","discription":"\n\n\nIf you have ever wanted to live the life of an NBA player, you probably are now. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLeBron James is playing cards with his family.

That\u2019s when the world shifted under their feet. \n\nChange had already been afoot as fears of infection from COVID-19 grew. Conferences like the ACC had already demanded their athletes return home from the event, which was supposed to be held with no spectators in attendance. The pre-meet banquet was canceled, and the coaches meeting was held online. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Trojans had just completed their warm-ups and were about to begin practice when program director Caryl Smith Gilbert received the phone call: The indoor championships were canceled, along with every other winter and spring NCAA championship. \n\nSmith Gilbert directed her athletes over to the training table so she could break the news, but even as they made their way over they couldn\u2019t help but hear as other teams cried out about the cancellation. \nThen the coach addressed her team, 13 members of which had traveled to Albuquerque, before they got on a chartered flight home as USC wanted the team to avoid commercial flight during the pandemic. \n\n\u201cI just told them this is how life works. This is how things go. Your health and safety is of the utmost importance,\u201d Smith Gilbert recalled. \u201cThey were crying. \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I hate this. Sometimes life just isn\u2019t fair.\u2019 \u201c \n\nA week later, you could still hear the pain in Smith Gilbert\u2019s voice as she recalled the abrupt end to their season. \n\n\u201cThat might\u2019ve been one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever had to do, ever, as a coach,\u201d Smith Gilbert said. \u201cAnd even more so with the reality that they canceled the outdoor championship as well, to tell especially my seniors that their season was over. I think it took us all some time to digest it. I don\u2019t think it still has registered completely. I keep thinking maybe they\u2019re going to reinstate it, even though I know they\u2019re not. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really tough to swallow, knowing that they\u2019ve been training since September.\u201d \nSmith Gilbert, named a finalist for national women\u2019s coach of the year for the indoor season Friday, has been told most USC seniors want to return for next track season after the NCAA announced it would grant an extra year of eligibility to spring student-athletes. \n\nThe question is exactly what the details would be surrounding that extra season. \n\nSmith Gilbert is a member of the NCAA executive board for track and field. She says there have been talks among coaches that these returning seniors shouldn\u2019t have to take any classes next year. But she prefers to see the seniors take advantage by taking grad school courses. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great opportunity. I don\u2019t know what the NCAA will decide,\u201d she said. \u201cSchool is always a great thing in my opinion. But there\u2019s so many unanswered hypotheses right now, who knows what will happen.\u201d \n\nSmith Gilbert said she\u2019s been told there could be decisions made on the guidelines for the extra year of eligibility within the next week. \n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t wait too long because people have things up in the air, their lives are on hold and decisions have to be made,\u201d Smith Gilbert said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to apply for grad school, you need to do that.

But if there\u2019s an opportunity with a team \u2026 it ended up being with this organization and that made it that much more exciting,\u201d he said. \n\nRivers feels he has plenty to offer even after one of his worst seasons. \n\nHe threw 23 touchdown passes, his lowest total since 2007, and 20 interceptions, matching the second-highest total of his career. While some blamed the troubles on a poor offensive line or Rivers trying to do too much to rally the Chargers late in games, others contended his skills were rapidly deteriorating. \n\nNow, with a fresh start, a strong running game and one of the league\u2019s top offensive lines, Rivers insists he will prove the critics wrong this season. \n\n\u201cI feel great and if I feel like I do next year then I\u2019ll be excited to keep on going, depending on how the team feels about it,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI do want to coach my oldest son (in high school). I have two sons, they\u2019re 12 and eight, so we\u2019ve got a little time. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see me in the Tom Brady range, but I feel good and I feel like I can help a team win a championship.\u201d \nRivers suspected he was headed into his first foray in free agency when he tearfully told reporters at season\u2019s end he would not quit. In February, the Chargers made it official by announcing the two sides mutually agreed to part ways. \n\nSo Rivers, his wife and their nine children moved to the family home in northwest Florida and contemplated their options. Yes, he considered starting his long-desired coaching career even as speculation swirled about potential landing spots. \n\nBut Rivers decided he just wanted to keep playing. \n\nAnd when free agency opened this week, Rivers was hopeful he could reunite with Frank Reich and Nick Sirianni, two of his former position coaches, in Indy. Reich is starting his third as the Colts\u2019 play-calling head coach while Sirianni continues in his role as offensive coordinator. \n\n\u201cPhilip is one of the most decorated quarterbacks in the NFL and we are fortunate to add an experienced player of his caliber to our organization,\u201d Colts general manager Chris Ballard said in a statement. \u201cHis familiarity with our coaching staff and offensive system, in addition to his experience, were attractive qualities during our evaluation process. Philip is a fierce competitor and his veteran leadership will be crucial in the continued development of our young roster.\u201d \n\nThey\u2019re hoping Rivers leads them to the playoffs after the Colts stumbled to a 7-9 record last season. \n\nFirst, he must beat out incumbent stater Jacoby Brissett, who struggled during the second half last season after injuring his left knee. Brissett, like Rivers, is a North Carolina State alum, but the two haven\u2019t spoken yet this week, Rivers said. \n\nBut in the meantime, with a challenging offseason looming, Rivers wants to keep the goals simple: Meeting his new teammates, learning the offense and being ready to go whenever football resumes. \n\n\u201cBuilding a friendship, building a relationship is huge and that\u2019s really my favorite part of this game, just being a great teammate,\u201d he said. \u201cI love being a teammate, I want to be one of the guys and I want them to know that.\u201d \n\nA message from the man himself: \n\u2014 Indianapolis Colts (@Colts) \n\n"},"15":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tKings, Ducks say none of their players have coronavirus symptoms\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/18\/kings-ducks-say-none-of-their-players-have-coronavirus-symptoms\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/GettyImages-12034799-16x9-1-1.jpg?w=620","discription":"\nOne day after an Ottawa Senator became the first NHL player to test positive for the coronavirus, the Kings and Ducks each said Wednesday that none of their players had symptoms of COVID-19, but were in self-quarantine either at their in-season or off-season homes. \n\nThe teams didn\u2019t say whether any players, coaches or staff had been tested, however. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Kings were the last team to play against the unnamed player and his Senators teammates in a March 11 game at Staples Center, the last to be completed before the NHL suspended play indefinitely the following day.

Now that the NHL has suspended its season because of the COVID-19 virus pandemic, the questions would appear to outnumber the answers by a wide margin as the league sought Friday to take steps to plan for whatever might come next. \n\nCommissioner Gary Bettman told players and staff members to \u201cself-isolate\u201d and stay away from rinks and team training facilities during the hiatus. He said in an interview with The Associated Press and NHL.com that he knew of no known cases involving the league\u2019s players. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u201cIt was clear to me that no matter what scenario we came up with that we continued to play with, either with or without fans, it was inconceivable, certainly unlikely that we were going to get through the rest of the regular season at a minimum without somebody testing positive,\u201d he said. \n\nIn fact, Carolina Hurricanes broadcaster John Forslund is self-quarantined at home in suburban Raleigh, North Carolina, after staying in the same hotel room in Detroit as Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert, the first NBA player to test positive for the coronavirus. \nHurricanes videographer Zach Brame also could have been exposed after he stayed in one of three rooms the Centers for Disease Control identified after the the Jazz departed the hotel Saturday and Carolina checked in Sunday, according the Raleigh News and Observer newspaper. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s serious,\u201d Forslund told the paper. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to listen to what we\u2019re supposed to do. And act accordingly. \u2026 Initially, we were all kind of in the same boat. And look where we are now. It\u2019s a serious thing. You just hope and pray everybody\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d \n\nBettman also said he didn\u2019t know when the league would resume play. The NBA and Major League Soccer each announced it would suspend play for 30 days. Major League Baseball canceled the remainder of spring training and the first two weeks of the season. \n\nIn addition, Bill Daly, the NHL\u2019s deputy commissioner, said in a statement that players should remain in their team\u2019s city for the time being. He didn\u2019t not forbid travel if a player\u2019s family resides in another city or if there are other unusual circumstances, however. \n\nDaly did not provide a date when players could resume working out at the team\u2019s facility. \n\u201cWe envision there coming a time where we transition direction from \u2018stay at home\u2019 to opening club facilities to players to work out and to skate on a voluntary basis in small groups similar to what we generally see prior to the beginning of team training camps,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m not in a position to say when that will be. We will see how the next week or so plays out.\u201d \n\nMeanwhile, Ducks owners Henry and Susan Samueli, who also operate Honda Center, have decided to continue pay all full- and part-time workers who were scheduled to work events while the arena is shuttered through March 31. \n\nJosh Harris and David Blitzer, the New Jersey Devils\u2019 managing partners, also have pledged to compensate their hourly and event staff at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, while NHL games and other events are suspended. \n\nKelly Cheeseman, the Kings\u2019 chief operating officer, said during a conference call Thursday he couldn\u2019t provide an immediate answer as to whether AEG would continue to pay arena workers at Staples Center. He said discussions were ongoing. \n\nBettman said it would not be strictly up to the NHL as to when it resumes its season. He also didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of playing in empty arenas and added that games would continue only when the situation is deemed to be safe enough to play again. \n\nThe league is determined to award the Stanley Cup even if it means playing in July. The league\u2019s regular season was to conclude April 4, with the playoffs to begin four days later. The last possible day for the Stanley Cup Final was set for June 13. \n\n\u201cThat would be the goal,\u201d Bettman said of completing the season. \u201cHealth, safety, well-being of the NHL family, especially and including our fans, is most important. If the business considerations and the money were the only thing, then we and a bunch of others would keep playing.\u201d \n  \n\t\t\t"},"17":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tMLS extends season postponement to May 10 due to coronavirus\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/19\/mls-extends-season-postponement-to-may-10-due-to-coronavirus\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/MLS-All-Star-Game-Soccer-2-1.jpg?w=525","discription":"\nMajor League Soccer announced in a statement Thursday it was extending the postponement of the season and has set a target return date of May 10. \n\nThe new date comes in accordance with the CDC\u2019s recent announcement to postpone events involving more than 50 people for the next eight weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe league, according to the statement, remains focused on playing the entire 34-game regular season, which would push back the end of the regular season and move the MLS Cup into December. \n\nEach team had played two games before the league announced it was suspending play because of the coronavirus outbreak. \nThe regular season was scheduled to end Oct. 4, with the MLS Cup set for early November. \n\n\u201cThroughout this process, MLS will continue to prioritize the safety of our fans, players, employees and partners and to coordinate with federal and local public health authorities as well as other sporting organizations,\u201d the statement said. \n\nOn Sunday, MLS sent out a memo extending the team training moratorium through Friday.

Looking back, I should\u2019ve insisted on being tested, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d \n\nShe stayed overnight in L.A. before returning to the airport for the final leg of her journey home to Arizona \u2013 where, as of Friday, there were 63 confirmed COVID-19 cases and no deaths, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services. On Monday, March 16, Wiese went to a Phoenix-area doctor and asked to be tested, conscious of the risks associated with her recent travel history. \n\nShe was told that because there was confusion over the testing protocol, and because she seemed healthy, she didn\u2019t qualify. \n\n\u201cI pushed for a test, but ended up giving up the fight, understanding the solution whether I had it or not would still be at least two weeks of quarantine, vitamins, water,\u201d Wiese said. \u201cAnd that is what I am doing now.\u201d \n\nShe went back to her parents\u2019 place, where she\u2019s been vigilant \u2013 even though she\u2019s shown no symptoms of having the virus: \u201cI have remained mindful of where I have been this last week \u2026 and I keep my distance from them, even within our house.\u201d \n\nShe said she feels healthy, that\u2019s she\u2019s getting readjusted to the time zone change, and moreover, that she\u2019s finding she appreciates having a lull in the year-round action that she and so many women\u2019s players normally endure. \n\n\u201cI have been grateful to stop,\u201d she said. \u201cI am grateful for the stillness, for the time with my parents (at a distance), for the attention to taking care of myself, checking in with my friends and family.\u201d \n\nAnd, Wiese added, we\u2019re all in this together \u2013 from La Seu d\u2019Urgell to Phoenix. \n\n\u201cWe are united in the same confusion, fight, and adjustment to this new rhythm,\u201d she said. \u201cI encourage everyone to proceed with social distancing, washing the hands thoroughly, and viewing this virus through a lens of respect. Many of us may be fortunate, having healthy immune systems, but our responsibilities are great and required. \n\n\u201cStay home, learn to enjoy the stillness, fill your time with good things and understand these days are temporary. It is important for all of us to listen to our medical officials and trust our efforts will help our country improve past this virus, but it takes all of us.\u201d \n\nThe WNBA season is scheduled to begin May 15, but it\u2019s unknown how that \u2013 or the 2020 WNBA Draft or training camp, all set for April \u2013 will be affected by the outbreak. \n\nIn a statement last week, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the league\u2019s priority was the well-being of its members: \u201cThe health and safety of players and employees, with our teams and at the league level is of the utmost importance.\u201d \n\nI went to the doctor this morning, hoping to be tested for the virus, just to be safe. The doctor told me I SEEM healthy. Since they are still trying to figure out testing protocol, there are only enough tests for people who are REALLY showing symptoms \n\n\u2014 Sydney Wiese (@swiesebaby24) \n\n"},"19":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tWhicker: Roger Mayweather, the original Mamba, was just as outspoken and lethal\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/18\/whicker-roger-mayweather-the-original-mamba-was-just-as-outspoken-and-lethal\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/0319_SPO_LDN-L-WHICKER2-1.jpg?w=495","discription":"\nBack when Kobe Bryant was dunking on 3-foot rims, Roger Mayweather was watching a nature special on TV and learning about the black mamba. \n\nWhen the snake strikes, there\u2019s no need to count to 10. Mayweather liked that, so he became \nHis nickname would be upstaged, and so would his own surname, because nephew Floyd Mayweather Jr. came along to go 50-0. But in the \u201980s, Roger brought honesty into the ring, the kind that reverberated all the way to Tuesday, when, at 58, he died after a brutal struggle with diabetes. \n\nJohn Beyrooty, the great Herald-Examiner boxing writer turned publicist, was only half-joking when he called Roger \u201cthe best fighter in the family.\u201d He was differentiating Floyd\u2019s style, which was one of the first examples of social distancing, from Roger\u2019s, which was fanged and merciless. \nRoger was 59-13 with 35 knockouts, but seven of those losses came in the \u201990s. He was a super-featherweight and super-lightweight champ. He fought only once in his Grand Rapids, Mich., home. Instead, the Mamba was invasive. In 1983, he went to Puerto Rico and took Sammy Serrano\u2019s 130-pound belt, in a true road game, with an eighth-round TKO. \n\nRoger had 11 fights in five L.A. locations, and he damaged the careers of a procession of young Mexicans. Along the way, he became known as the \u201cMexican Assassin.\u201d Roger, nodding to the promoters, would sometimes walk in with a serape and a sombrero. \n\nIn 1987, he floored Rene Arredondo three times in the sixth round and lifted his 140-pound belt at the Sports Arena. Mayweather defended it four times before Julio Cesar Chavez came up from 135. After 10 rounds of body work, Mayweather did not come out for the 11th. Chavez again finished Mayweather in a two-round rematch. \n\nThe kitchen table in Grand Rapids was a boxing Rosetta Stone. Roger and Floyd Sr. and their brother Jeff talked boxing endlessly. Floyd Jr. took in every word. \n\nIn the gym, Floyd Sr. often wore a T-shirt that read, \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know (Deleted) About Boxing,\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d was pretty much everybody, although Roger respected the brain of his longtime trainer, Jesse Reid. \nRoger\u2019s manager was Billy Baxter, a seven-time World Series of Poker champion from Augusta, Ga. One night Baxter told Bruce Trampler, the Top Rank matchmaker, that Roger had a bad hand and wouldn\u2019t be able to go. Trampler went to Roger and asked him about it. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d Roger replied, \u201cbut I\u2019ll break this bitch if I have to.\u201d He went ahead and won. \n\n\u201cHe was one of my favorite fighters,\u201d Trampler said. \u201cHe had a great straight right hand, but his hook was pretty good, too. He brought danger, but he always knew what he was doing in the ring. He wasn\u2019t in there throwing wild shots. He would walk guys down, and he wouldn\u2019t miss punches. He was very, very good at setting up traps for guys. That\u2019s how Floyd Jr. learned to do it himself.\u201d \n\nFloyd Jr. was an explosive featherweight and lightweight, but Roger was also training him then. Floyd Sr. became the trainer after he was released from prison. He wanted defense, Roger wanted offense. The debate was not always respectfully waged. \n\nNo matter what, Roger was a fierce advocate for his nephew. He also was \nIn 2016, Floyd fought Zab Judah, whose family was just as loud as Mayweather\u2019s. When Judah\nBefore one of his bigger Las Vegas fights, Floyd Jr. was claiming the throne, not just that day but for all time. He claimed he was better than Muhammad Ali, Ray Robinson, Joe Louis, Ray Leonard or anybody else who had ever lived. \n\nWriters went to Roger and asked if he agreed. \n\n\u201cWell, what you don\u2019t realize is that Floyd, he\u2019s undefeated,\u201d Roger said, with disdainful eyes. \u201cAnd all these other (deleted) that you\u2019re talking about? They\u2019re defeated!\u201d \n\nFloyd Jr. decisioned a 23-year-old Canelo Alvarez in 2013. Beforehand, someone asked Roger if he had been impressed by Canelo\u2019s victory over Austin Trout. \n\n\u201cYou got to realize something about my nephew,\u201d Roger replied. \u201cWhen Canelo gets in the ring this time, he ain\u2019t going in there against some salmon. No, he\u2019s going to be there with some steak!\u201d \n\nThe Mamba\u2019s career was well done, too. \n  \n\t\t\t"},"20":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tGlobal athletes group calls for IOC to postpone Olympics over coronavirus\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/03\/22\/global-athletes-group-calls-for-ioc-to-postpone-olympics-over-coronavirus\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Olympics-Tokyo-Flame-Arrival-1.jpg?w=525","discription":"\nA worldwide group representing Olympic hopefuls is calling on the IOC to postpone the Tokyo Olympics until the coronavirus pandemic is under control. \n\n\u201cAs the world unites to limit the spread of Covid-19 virus, the IOC \u2026 must do the same,\u201d\u00a0Global Athlete\u00a0said in a news release Sunday. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThis show of solidarity among Olympic hopefuls adds to the dozens of individual athletes who have come out against the IOC\u2019s current stance, which is to start the games as scheduled on July 24. \n\nThe IOC is in consultation with the World Health Organization and has stuck to the position that it\u2019s too early for drastic decisions. \n\u201cIt\u2019s bizarre the IOC hasn\u2019t shown any real leadership,\u201d said Caradh O\u2019Donovan, a Global Athlete founder from Ireland whose karate training has been put on hold due to restrictions in her country. \u201cThey\u2019re acting as though it\u2019s business as usual and it just seems very strange.\u201d \n\nO\u2019Donovan said the unevenness around the globe regarding training, doping control and qualifying standards are among her key concerns \u2014 thoughts echoed by a number of athletes on social media and in interviews with The Associated Press over the past few days. \n\n\u201cAthletes want to be part of a solution to ensure the Games are a success,\u201d the Global Athlete statement said. \u201cBut under the current global restrictions that are limiting public gatherings as well as closing training facilities and borders, athletes do not have the ability to appropriately prepare for these Games, and their health and safety must come first.\u201d \n\nThe group also called on broadcasters, specifically NBC, and sponsors \u201cto adopt the same level of duty of care toward athletes by supporting the IOC and (International Paralympic Committee) with flexibility and understanding during these uncharted times.\u201d \n\nThe statement came out a few hours after U.S. athletes took part in a conference call to share their feelings about the crisis and the possibility of a postponed Olympics. The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee is distributing a survey to athletes, with hopes of sharing some of the responses at an IOC meeting next week. \nOn Saturday, one of America\u2019s best-known Olympians, hurdler and bobsledder Lolo Jones, told the Associated Press she was hoping the IOC would respond with a postponement. \n\n\u201cIf our job as Olympians and Olympic hopefuls is to inspire society and be healthy, we\u2019re going in direct conflict with that by going out in public to find gyms and tracks and pools that are still open to train for the Games,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSome people are doing that because the IOC is telling us to stay ready, to keep training.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a thought being echoed by the Global Athlete group. \n\n\u201cMy dream is to go to the Olympics this year but it\u2019s an impossible task from my perspective and it\u2019s the same for a huge number of athletes,\u201d O\u2019Donovan said. \u201cI\u2019d be absolutely stunned if they go on in July, as planned.\u201d \n  \n\t\t\t"}}
